    <p>My name is Akshat Jiwan Sharma. I live in Gurgaon, India. It used to be a small town though it is not anymore. I graduated in computer science in 2011. I work as an independant contractor on <a href="https://www.odesk.com/users/~01ee4d19be0ec63fe0">odesk</a> </p>
    
    <p>I also program as a hobbyist to solve my own problems. I have a few projects on my <a href="https://github.com/brickcap">github</a> account : </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/brislink/Abstract">Abstract</a> a drafting tool that I use daily for writing stuff.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/brislink/specter">Specter</a> a blogging platform which I use every three days to write blog posts.</p> <p>I mostly program with javascript both on client side and server side. I am learning erlang as well, very slowly. </p> 

    <p>I blog on a variety of topics. I have discovered that writing is a good remedy for confusion and anxiety. It calms me down and makes me look at my problems more objectively. </p> 

    <p> If you have an interesting work related opportunity for me or if you just want to say hello, you can email me at </p> <p>akshat_fullmetal@yahoo.co.in</p> <p>or</p> <p>akshatjiwan@gmail.com</p>
