	<h1>Hello, my name is Akshat Jiwan Sharma.</h1>
	<p> I live in Gurgaon, India. It used to be a small town though it is not anymore. I graduated in computer science in 2011. I work as an <a href="http://www.staticshin.com/how-can-i-help-you/">Independent consultant.</a> I like to write, mostly here on my blog, but I am also on <a href="https://twitter.com/brickcap">twitter</a>.My email id is: akshatjiwan@gmail.com. Random fact:- I don't mind spam as long it's well done :)</p>
	<strong>As long as we are talking random....</strong>
	<p>
	  I suppose you already know that some lizards break off their tails when threatened, so that they can
	  escape while their predator is distracted by the wriggling object. But did you also know that some lizards
	  store additional fat in their tail? During the days when food is in short supply they use their tails for
	  nutrition. The motion of the tail when it's shed is an object of deep
          <a href="http://www.livescience.com/5684-severed-lizard-tail-mind.html" target="_blank">
	    scientific curiosity</a>. Cool right? 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Lizards which do not shed the tail are also quite interesting.
	  Monitor lizards, for example, may lay their eggs in a termite mound. The mother first demolishes
	  the existing mounds, then she lays her eggs in the remains and then she calmly leaves the premises
	  as if nothing happened. I found this behaviour quite shocking when I carefully
	  examined the circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p>
	  Now here is a big giant[1] lizard who has just finished ruthlessly crushing the termite nest. She
	  has got no sign of remorse on her face. She gives absolutely no hint that she is sorry for what she did.
	  Instead she goes on ahead and lays her eggs in the dilapidated remains. She does not even have the
	  decency to assist in repairs. Oh no! our majesty the "Lady monitor" would not stoop to the ground.
	  She would twist her tail and leave for her chambers where she would like to have a moment or two
	  of repose. Meanwhile the poor termites repair their castle and in the process they enclose the eggs within it
	  giving them both protection from predators and a perfect environment for incubation.

	<p>And here is a random quote:-</p>
	<blockquote>
	  Why should I not publish my diary?  I have often seen reminiscences of people I have never even heard of, and I fail to see--because I do not happen to be a 'Somebody'--why my diary should not be interesting.  My only regret is that I did not commence it when I was a youth. ---

	<p>
	  [1] Big giant lizard? Didn't you mean big fat lizard?
	</p>
	<p>
	  I agree that big fat lizard sounds more natural in this context. "A big fat
	  lizard swooping over the termite nest" is definitely more dramatic and sensical. Where
	  as "big giant" seems a little redundant. I should have used either big or giant but not both.
	  But still I would like to defend my choice of words here. I used "big giant" instead of "big fat" for
	  one very simple reason. No female, whether a monitor lizard or a human, likes to be called fat. They
	  are very sentimental about it. I can tell you from a very painful personal experience that it is
	  in bad taste to call any (and I use the word 'any' in the broadest sense) female fat. 
	  Especially if she has the ability to bite your leg off. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Anyway,I think that 'big' goes well with a lot of different words. You can have "big fat","big boss",
	  "big giant","big bully" etc no problem. Except for small. "Big small" just sounds stupid.
