          <p>So the basic syntax of wordpress is very simple. The declaration of variables, conditional statements, loops , defining and using functions is very similar to other languages. The ternary operator is back. I missed it a lot in lua so it's a big positive for me.</p>
	  
          <p>On the other hand php is an object oriented language. Much of the theory of abstract classes and interfaces went right over my head. I have a good idea of how these things work but I'm not very comfortable in writing using OO principles in my own code (its been 4 years or so since I used to do OOP in .net). I don't think that it's going to be a problem  for the time being, because at the moment I need to read code  not write it. And whatever little pieces that I will write won't involve object oriented programming, just a couple of functions so I should be fine. By the time I'm done reading the code I should have a good mental model of OOP in PHP and hopefully I should be able to do little things on my own.</p>
          <p>Overall I liked php. For once I'm going to program in a language that is extremely popular. I hope the open source libraries and ready made projects will make my work easier.</p>
