    <h1>Activity Log -- <small>Lets call it Freddy because Kitty is such a girly name</small></h1>
    <p class="date">13, Sep 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Woke up late, bathed early.</li>
      <li>Went to get the mobile repaired,the shop was closed.
	Will have to go there again tomorrow,I guess</li>        
      <li>Spent the day doing chores (cooked!, edited old posts) and answering emails.</li>
      <li class="reading">Tried reading but was too distracted.Watched Dr House instead.</li>
      <li class="milestone">Finally started the activity log so the day was not entirely useless :) </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">14, Sep 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="people">Had a great breakfast (<em>kale chane and halwa!</em>). Anirudh cooks really well. </li>
      <li class="writing">Collected articles and reference materials for a post on Mutual Authentication Systems (MAS)
      </li>
      <li>Went to the mobile repair shop despite the rains. Was relieved when the guy in charge accepted the warranty on the phone without making much fuss about the broken SIM slot. Hopefully the manufacturer will comply as well.</li>
      <li class="people">Anirudh got an SMS for jio sim activation. Couldn't figure out how to actually "activate" it .Wasted the entire afternoon running after the reliance representative, who in turn suggested that we call the customer care instead. The customer care could not be reached .</li>
      <li>Went for a walk in the evening. It rained. I got wet.</li>
      <li class="reading">Had dinner at Manipal. Answered some emails. Ended the day after reading Chesterton and Aristotle. </li>
      <li>Have decided that I'd finish everything by 11 PM and write the log before going to sleep.</li>
    </ul>

      <li class="reading">Started reading about corporate and investment banking in the morning. Had a headache by 11. Went out to get some bananas.They were heavenly.</li>
      <li>It rained all afternoon. Stopped for a little while in the evening. I managed to go for a walk without getting wet. </li>
      <li>Talked with guys from wescott capital. They suggested that I update my linkedin profile. I really want to do that,but it's boring to write about work related stuff. Maybe someday.</li>
      <li>It rained in the night. Got wet on way to dinner. Good thing I took my jacket.</li>
      <li class="people">Prepared a pitch for Prashanthi. She wanted "low hanging fruits" in corporate banking. The initial plan was low hanging enough. Was afraid that if I "lowered" it any further the fruit might fall on the ground and rot. Therefore I added "low hanging" in the title and reworded the same pitch. I think it's good to go. Will find out tomorrow.</li>
      <li class="reading">Didn't read any good stuff. Will make up for the loss in the weekend.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="date">16 Sep 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="people">The talk with Prashanthi went ok. She was very helpful though I get the feeling that they are not much interested in the ideas that we pitch, rather they've already got a set of problems that they want  solved. We're more like consultants/programming talent rather than founders. Which is perfectly fine, if they are upfront about it. Can't do much except hope for the best. Let's see how it goes.</li>
      <li class="reading"> It rained all afternoon just like yesterday.Couldn't go out for lunch so I decided to read instead. In all but 60 minutes Chesterton set my soul on fire! The man is incredible. If he were alive I would first like to box with him. Then I would want to debate with him. And after we've worked a sufficient appetite I'd like to dine with him,peacefully. Maybe listen to a few songs afterwords. He seems to talk about everything but music!</li>
      <li>The rain stopped for a while and I did go out for food. I was so hungry that I could have gladly eaten grass. Had American chop suey instead. Liked it. </li>
      <li>Slept in the afternoon. Went for a walk in the evening, enjoyed it thoroughly. On my way back I saw the full moon shining in the clouds. Occasionally it came out. Very beautiful scene. Could have easily watched it all night. </li>
      <li class="places">Went out for dinner as well. Had curd rice. After that I went to Lillie's and treated myself to a Groovy Judy milkshake (papaya+pineapple). Shouldn't have had it. Will probably have trouble sleeping tonight :)</li>
      <li class="places">On my way back I stopped at the jetty. They moon was quite high by then. Stood at my usual place, just near the edge of platform with the watchtower. There were some fishermen there. It was high tide today, the waves were pretty strong. I really like that place though I don't come here as often I used to. Guess I'll move again somewhere close to it.  </li>
      <li>I won't be eating any Bananas for a month at least. I'll try other fruits. Probably start with oranges.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Interesting last couple of days. First I got stuck with a programming related issue. Wasn't able to figure out why openssl could not read the ".rand" file when being called from openresty. Since nginx ran as root it should have had access to every file. It turns out that the worker process, by default, runs as "nobody" and apparently it didn't have sufficient privileges to write to the '.rand' file. The solution was simple enough, just had to add a single line of configuration but I wasted a lot of time on this. Anyway it's a breakthrough and the rest of the stuff is not too hard to do. Just time consuming.</li>
      <li> Then I had a very good debate on hacker news on our "Blue oceans for banks" proposal. Defending the plan against some of the critiques has given me even more ideas on how we can make this work. I'm more convinced than ever that we have a very good plan on our hands. And if we can get a banking partner to believe in it, it can become something big. Or in the worst case the concept can be executed by someone with more resources.</li>
      <li class="places">Went to Miramar on Sunday. Met with Shijin. It was nice. </li>
      <li>I cooked today.... I've noticed that I've been acting a bit out of character lately. I think I need to take a break and do some self examination. There's something fishy going on the upper floor. I get a feeling that the monkeys are about to revolt.
      </li>
      <li>Lots of pending tasks.There's a possibility of a new consulting assignment coming through. Have to write pitches for corporate banking services and send them to the contacts. In addition there are a couple of posts that I'm planning to write. Might have to postpone some stuff or put in more hours. The best thing to do is get things done and not leave them hanging. Even if it's a bit uncooked(!). I can always comeback and polish some of the stuff that has already been done.</li>
      <li>I don't think there's any point to wait till bedtime to write a post in the log. Best to do it when I have the time/something noteworthy has happened.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">20 Sep 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Good day today. Woke up early and got to work straight away. Completed the design of MAS. Just need to write a post to explain the steps involved in building such a system in a clear, concise way. I feel that it could also be a very good use case for openresty. Might be able to kill two birds with one stone.</li>
      <li>The client was supposed to email me the details of the server and cloudant instance. Didn't mail. Didn't call. I think I should not waste any more time waiting. Better to focus energies on other pending tasks.</li>
      <li class="places people">Anirudh decided that he wanted to travel today. So we left at 4 to Salim Ali Bird statuary. We didn't see any birds but we saw a lot of mangroves and crabs. Mangroves are really cool plants. Can grow in salty water and create a vibrant sub ecosystem consisting of a curious mix of marine and land  animals. They are very hardy and have developed useful survival mechanism like air tubes(called pneumatophores) coming out of swampy land that allow them to breathe even in excess of water. Besides that we also read that they have medicinal properties and the wood from their trunk can be used in furniture. I find them fascinating.</li>
      <li class="reading">Planning to read the dogood papers and Emerson before going to sleep.</li>
      <li>It's been almost a week since I've eaten a banana. I'm suffering from withdrawal but I must be strong. Go go go!</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">21 Sep 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Well something just had to go wrong. Anirudh decided that he didn't want to work on wrinq anymore. I'm really upset. Don't know if I'll be able to make it all alone. Maybe I'll have to give up on the idea. But if I do I'd like to pass on whatever I've learnt.</li>
      <li> Not really sure what I should do next. Should I persist and persevere? or Should I let go and change course?Both choices look equally unappealing to me. </li>
      <li>I talked with my old landlord and asked if he'd consider letting me back again in his place. He agreed. I think I'll move. I like that place. It's very upbeat. Good positive vibes. I need some positivity at the moment.</li>
      <li> I tried to write a detailed plan for BBVA but it didn't come out as expected.
	I'll keep working on it tomorrow. Let's just hope that tomorrow turns out to better than today.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">24 Sep 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="people">The worst has passed, I believe. Anirudh is preparing to move on. I'm helping him as much as I can. He won't be continuing with wrinq but I guess it's all right.I've decided that I won't quit just yet. I have some good ideas that may be tricky to pull off but they are definitely doable. </li>
      <li class="places">Yesterday we went to the food festival. It was more like " things you prepare food with" festival. But we had fun. They were giving away free nachos, we tried all flavours! </li>
      <li class="ideas"> I've gotten an idea of adding an auto reload feature to restyskeleton. So that I don't have to deal with restarting nginx every time the configuration files change. I've already defined the directory structure so I think it should be simple enough. Lets see if I can make sometime to implement this. </li>
      <li>There is still a lot of stuff pending but I'm catching up slowly. If I can respond to emails and write a teaser to the pitch in the weekend I should be able to make a lot of progress in the coming week. Maybe things can even start to look up!</li>         
    </ul>
    <p class="date">25 Sep 2016</p>
    <li class="milestone">Released a new version of openresty skeleton today! Added a parameter that watches for changes in .lua and nginx configuration files and automatically restarts nginx if any change is detected. I think the application is now maturing nicely. I'll add tests in a later release but right now I'm pretty satisfied with the way it works. Since I made it I've created lots of quick and dirty openresty applications and I've noticed that my own productivity with openresty has gone up. Maybe it will help other people as well. I think it's a win win.</li>
    <li class="people">Arun came today to meet me after a long time,I was really happy to see him. He is planning to resign. Says he doesn't like working with those people. I suggested that he should put some effort into building up his profile on linkedin and angellist. He is a good developer. He has done good stuff but he should also learn how to showcase what he has done.On the plus side he has good spirit and I have no doubt that he will recover from any temporary set back. I'll help him if I can. Anyway comparing his situation with mine, I think that I made a pretty good move by leaving that place early.</li>
    <li>One of the best things that has happened in this week is that I've finally gotten my mobile back! This means that I can read books outside. On the downside I'll have to re install all those apps again. Also the second SIM slot broke again but the guy at the repair shop has agreed to replace it free of charge. Good fellow! I'll go there tomorrow and get it fixed once and for all.</li>
    <li class="writing">I'm planning to send out the new pitch that I wrote for corporate banking by Tuesday. For that I'll have to prepare a teaser. The problem is that I'll probably have to create two or three versions of the teasers that appeal to different contacts. If I can make a couple of them today and revise the pitch to give it some finishing touches tomorrow I think I'll be prepared by Tuesday.</li>
    <li class="writing">The post on mutual authentication systems seems to have been stuck. I'll try to complete at least the README for the code section by this week and get back to working on the post in the next one.</li>
    <li class="reading">Finally I've been thoroughly enjoying the dogood papers. I'm pretty much convinced that Ben Franklin was a big troll.</li>
    <p class="date">29 Sep 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="peope">Anirudh left. He was supposed to leave today but he changed plans at the last minute. I dropped him at the bus stop in the evening. Sad to see him leave, but can't do anything about it.</li>
      <li class="milestone"> I moved to my old place as well. Shijin helped a lot in moving my stuff. Would have been really difficult otherwise.</li>
      <li class="milstone">I got an official confirmation of being accepted into the barclays accelerator yesterday. It's a bit bittersweet and I'm left wondering if Anirudh had postponed his decision by a week how different things would look now.</li>
      <li class="milestone"> I finished the README for "MAS" example with openresty. It's a little victory but it allows me to proceed with my "MAS" post.</li>
      <li>I officially started a new client project yesterday. Looking forward to see where this leads. Time to pick up the pieces and move forward.</li>

      <li class="milestone places"> I've been in Goa for an year now. And after all the travelling I've done it still feels fresh. It's a bit strange to note that despite Goa being a tourist attraction the locals here are reserved. The nature is welcoming, the people are withdrawn. I don't mind this at all as it leaves me free to do whatever I want.  </li>
      <li>Had to present to the Barclays team on Friday. Wasn't prepared so I gave a short impromptu speech on the business explaining the concepts in the simplest possible way. Overall I think I did well. The panel there asked a few questions which were not all that challenging, I felt. They asked about the technology stack, who is going to use this solution etc all standard and all generic. I guess they have to fill their quota of startups and they don't really care how they do it. I think I might actually make it. But then again I might not! If I do make it will I be able to do what I want? or will it be another uphill battle this time with the internal team?  Who knows?   </li>
      <li>Already the episode with Anirudh feels like a distant memory. I'm back to my old ways and habits. Pitching to banks, presenting the concept to business who would actually benefit by it, writing articles, looking for consulting work to sustain myself. Some times it can get really hard but its worth it because at the end of the day, when all is said and done I feel good. And feelin' good is good enough for me :)  </li>

      <li class="milestone">In all this commotion, of the last couple of weeks, I almost forgot to mention that I've finally gotten my law degree. That's right, I'm a lawyer now. I can take my own cases as soon as I clear the Bar exam (should be a piece of cake). Look out Perry Mason! </li>
      <li class="lesson">The consulting assignment that I took is looking a bit rocky. I think I under-quoted and the things that I'm supposed to fix are completely broken. By that I mean the application is not even running. Always do due diligence. Lesson learnt.</li>
      <li class="lesson"> One thing that I've come to understand is that programming by itself is not all that hard. You do need a certain amount of skill that takes effort to acquire. But after that it's all about sticking to the fundamentals. Simplicity (even in its most complex form), testability (even in its most difficult to test form) and a dedication towards solving problems (not necessarily by means of programming) gets you really far. The last point is important. If one is not invested in solving the problem a program can't come out good. If one is only interested in solving the problem by means of programming the solution will be inefficient. Good judgment is a surprisingly underrated skill in programmers. But I believe that it's very important. As a means of training a programmer should look at the task of writing program as chore. Something that is to be done only when it must be done. Restraint is essential in all aspects of life.</li>

      <li class="milestone places"> Had a great day yesterday. Finished clients work by 10 PM and went to jetty for a bit of reading. Something possessed me thereafter and I decided to go to Anjuna. Got stopped twice for checking by the police. They are a bit strict these days, due to upcoming elections I guess. Came back to Panji by 2 in the morning had coffee at Aunt Maria's before heading back home. Couldn't sleep though! </li>
      <li class="lesson people">I have observed on many occasions how particular women are of their appearance. Take today for example. At the wee hours of the morning when a person should feel all spent and tired after the days work, with a crumpled shirt and a drained odour, there are these flowers. Watered, perfumed, immaculately trimmed chatting away without a care in the world. Fresh as lilies at dawn. Ordinarily I would indulge in such a spectacle and breathe in this sweet aroma of nature. I would also learn a lesson or two in grooming oneself and develop an understanding on the art of talking trifles. But at that hour, their presence only made me extremely conscious of my relative wretchedness. So much so that it almost spoiled my enjoyment of the delicious coffee. Were it not for an extraordinary amount of awareness regarding the time at which a fellow is supposed to look like a rag I would perhaps have shifted in some dark corner to hide my shame. As it stood, however, I was quite content to disregard this ill-timed display of a spotless glow as nothing more than silly vanity and got back to sipping my coffee while contemplating the deep mysteries of the universe.</li>
      <li> I'm starting to really enjoy my new,old place. So much so that I decided to break my banana fast and buy half a dozen to celebrate my renewed enthusiasm towards life.</li>
      <li> I have begun a deep study of how airlines work as a business. I'm learning a lot of cool new things and principles that can be applied to other businesses as well. Hopefully after this study I can create a much better plan of action. </li>
      <li id="idea_page_start"> I've  created a separate page to capture all the ideas that I get. This way I can run some analysis on how long it takes me to go from the inception to the execution of a new thought. Will also help me keep a little sane, I guess. These wild thoughts of mine possess a demonic power leaving me restless unless I give them an audience. I can't deny their appeal but I can certainly schedule the hearing :)
        <small>[I restructured it as a todo list]</small>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">16 Oct 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="lesson">One of the things I've noticed is that whenever I "hoard" on my writing and try to save ideas before they are good enough to be written I write nothing at all. One of the reasons of starting with the activity log is to have a space where I can write really random and unconnected stuff on a day to day basis. It is important that I do that because if I don't the thoughts waiting to be written become too much for me to bear. They take a life of their own. I go a bit off in my head. Am I addicted to writing?</li>
      <li>Anyway, overall it were a hard couple of weeks because, well I made it hard. First I feel into the trap of trying to do too much at the same time, again. I tired to network on linkedin, write a pitch for airlines, juggle with a bit of consulting work and none of them came out as well as I expected. Once more I'm reminded how important it is to maintain focus.</li>
      <li> On the plus side the pitch was well received and I got a phone call with the surf air! It's on Monday and I'm outlining the theme of the talk. If I can get them I think it would be a huge validation for wrinq.</li>
      <li> On the not so positive note I'm getting a feeling that this consulting assignment is a bit of a dead end. The guy in charge is unenthusiastic about taking the thing forward. We had a hard, straight talk yesterday. I don't mind how slow it goes as long as I get my money and he does not waste my time. </li>
      <li>Going forward I'd like to put more energy working on ideas and concepts around wrinq and another business that I'm thinking about. Yes I need to focus, but I believe that focus needs to be renewed. If I work too long on a single thing my focus actually depletes. So it's better that I have one ambitious really long term goal and one immediately doable low energy plan. Like a jab,cross combo. So that I get a feeling of progress that gives me energy to keep working on the long term thing. </li>
      <li class="people">Thanks to Bhavya I finally got a reliance jio sim. No more internet troubles now!</li>

    <ul>
      <li class="milestone">I got rejected by Barclays :( In this moment of pain and suffering I can't seem to summon that stoic strength of mine that has served me so well in many of life's tribulations.FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK GOD DAMMNIT FUCK. Some times good old swearing is better than bearing the calamity with a calm disposition. FUCK THIS SHIT I SAY!!!! </li>
      <li>However my resolve is now stronger than ever. I'll show them. There are a couple more opportunities worth exploring. I'll have to put all into it. Now it's victory or death.</li>
      <li class="places lesson"> Went to Aarambol yesterday to slay some demons. The place is a gutter. The sweet water lake is shit. Hippies everywhere smoking, drinking "having a good time". Can't believe I once obsessed over... how the memory deceives with it's false charms. Need to move on quickly. I've wasted much of my precious time sulking and brooding. Moving on in 3,2,1...</li>
      <li> Over the last couple of months, things are not going exactly as planned. BAD SHIT IS HAPPENING! I need to start doing things without any expectations and just trust the spirit in the sky. Starting to trust in 3,2,1....</li>
      <li class="reading"> These days I've been reading letters from a stoic. Nice change from Plato. The ideas are easier to grasp. The reading is pretty light. The lessons are deep. Seneca is my new BFF. Of course I still make time for a couple of dialogues every now and then. Just a few days back I finished Charmides. Didn't like it much. In non fiction(!) it's PG Wodehouse again. I need to laugh more or else I'll have a stroke. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">24 Oct 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="places">All right so I'll have to go to Delhi to attend a few meetings. Booked the ticket for 30, should reach home by 7.Quite excited that I'll get to be at home for Diwali :) Haven't been able to celebrate with family for two years in a row now. Not proud of it!</li>
      <li>In the meantime I'll try to focus my efforts on preparing a good presentation. I've already noted down the points I want to talk about. I've already researched the topics. I just have to write the dialogue(How cool it sounds when I put it like that!) I'll have 5 minutes to talk. Will look to present the subject manner in the simplest possible manner.  </li>
      <li> Tomorrow I'll try a new style of working. I'm going to wake up early. Finish everything by 11. After that I won't be touching work. Rest of the day will be spent reading, planning and doing background stuff for the tasks that might come up ahead.</li>
      <li>While I can feel it in my bones that the idea behind wrinq will be a success, I think I underestimated how tough it will be to get started. These bankers are very stubborn and lazy and slow! No worries though. I guess that they will find out that I'm equally stubborn but not lazy and  definitely not slow. Evidence will show that on the contrary I'm quite fast. To a fault actually. Sometimes I feel that I need to slow down a bit! Tomorrow I'll try again wearing my lucky t-shirt.</li>
      <li>I'm very lucky that I developed a taste for Philosophy. I remember during my school days I never used to touch those kind of books. In fact I used to actively stay away from them. In those days it was only murder mysteries for me. Ah man the summer break used to be so sweet. Sherlock Holmes and some rain, what else does one need in life? But I tasted Philosophy at just the right time. Looking back if it were not for wise words of Socrates and Aristotle I probably would have taken a path that would have only lead to pain and suffering. I'm lucky in that respect, advice on life's most perplexing questions are within my reach. I just need to skim over a few paragraphs and cure any kind of bewilderment that inflicts it's curse upon everyone from time to time. </li>
      <li class="lesson">I've also decided that I'll be practicing more restraint in my life. Patience and temperance really are virtues. Thinking about virtues is easy but putting those ideas into practice in daily life is really hard. Self control is powerful but it takes a lot of inner strength to develop. Especially when there are few examples in front of us and the only people with such a mastery over themselves are the ones that we can only read about in books. But I'm not looking for absolute mastery. Just a cognizance of the times when I'm likely to slip is enough for me.</li>
      <li class="reading">Emerson is bad ass!</li>

    <ul>
      <li>All right lots to cover. Came to ggn on 30 as planned, had fun on Diwali. Went to startup bootcamp fasttrack in Delhi on 4th Nov. Had a good response there (purely based on novelty of the idea I suspect) but they don't start the program until March next year. I don't want to wait that long. My first impression is: I don't really see them all that enthusiastic. I understand that fintech is probably the most boring domain ever but one can at least pretend to be excited. It's gets tiring after a time putting in all that energy and getting nothing back in return. Whatever, I've stopped caring now. To make this work all I need is 1 believer. I just got to keep on pushing until I find one. </li>
      <li>Anyways, here's the exciting part. I found out that there was going to be a UK India tech summit in Delhi between 7,8 and 9. I jumped on the opportunity and registered myself for the event. It was a good decision. The summit had the who's who of the business world. Head of vodafone, Technology advisor of UK, Mayor of London, University directors, bank presidents etc. That's just what I wanted :) and I played my best game. Got the contact details of almost everyone who mattered.</li>
      <li class="lesson">It's important that when you go into these summits or business meeting or whatever, that you keep things simple. Don't try to "connect" with people when you first meet. I couldn't help but notice that some people really tired "win the people over" maybe out of civility, or a sense of fostering camaraderie. But in their ardour they don't consider the fact that based on the volume of people alone nothing of what they say will be remembered by the other person.And by holding them off with polite small talk you are just shutting down their brain so that when you do come around to say the stuff that actually matters they won't hear you. Here's what I do. I go in move two steps and stretch out a hand for a shake, introduce myself while the grip is still firm and then ask for a card to send them my plan. Takes 15 seconds and the other person does not have to expend too much mental energy trying to decide whether they like you or not. Don't give any room for things to get awkward. Respect their time and yours. Get the card and then get out. Don't get greedy.</li>
      <li class="lesson"> There's a possiblity that you might run into them again. And that would be a good time for small talk especially when there a boring session going on the stage. Nothing brings people together like being numbed by the same lecture. It's the best conversation starter there is.

      <li class="places"> Taj Palace itself was really good. Carpets everywhere, big halls, sunny outdoors,good food and scented bathrooms! Too bad I had to spend all my time inside conference rooms. But a good experience nonetheless.</li>
      <li>In between all this I've had lots of breakthrough ideas on how to proceed with wrinq. I've started reading ISO 20022 reference manual to understand how all this financial messaging works. On a side note I'm really appreciating XML (nice change from json) too bad that lua does not have an XSD validator. I came to know about RTGS systems which validates the concept. Now I can just point and say "see these things already exist" I'm building something just like that.</li>
      <li class="people">Alok is really unfortunate with Mobile phones. He had another one snatched from him. Poor guy. Next time I'm going to make him miserable until he gets an insurance (what can I do? Some people never learn). Also I must be a bit more careful myself.</li>

      <li class="places lesson">Came back to Goa on 21 Nov in quite high spirits. My stay in ggn proved fruitful and I was successful finding a way forward for wrinq. I'm at a stage where even having a sense of direction to move in is quite an encouraging thought. With all the uncertainty, just putting little steps one after the other gives me a sense of stability. Even though I'm quite far from my goal if I can keep moving I'll end up with something. At this point I've stopped focusing on the one goal and instead started carving out a lot of small achievable targets. For example:- Sure I can't build an international banking service at this point. But can I get my idea in front of a Bank MD, or an innovation manager? Can I get feedback on the services from a prospect? Those things are easy and achievable. Every yes gives me more confidence. Even a no is useful as at least it gets me a new connection.I need to figure out more of these win-win scenarios for myself.  </li>
      <li class="places lesson"> I spent three days on Agonda. Rented a shack there. Now, I'm not being an irresponsible spend thrift going out on pleasure trips. Though I'd certainly like be an irresponsible spend thrift every once in a while :), it's just that there is no point for me to keep sitting in my room when nothing is happening. I write a proposal and I set in motion the correspondence with people who can either give me feedback/help me achieve my goals and then there is nothing to do but wait. These things take time and happen at their own schedule. I can't do anything at this point. The best I can do then is to take some focus away from work. And every time I do that one of the two things happen:- either someone replies to my correspondence giving me an opportunity to keep the discussion going or I comeback with even more new ideas and themes to explore. Which in turns open up an entirely new channel of communication with people that keeps me busy for a week.</li>
      <li class="places">I found a new place. There's a chapel on top of a small hill in Betul on the way to Cancona.Although that chapel is like every other Chapel, it's got a magnificent view of the sea from it's ground. Very beautiful.</li>
      <li class="lesson">By the way nothing is more refreshing than watching people have fun on the beach. One feels happy when one is around people who are happy. Also swimming in the sea is way better than swimming in a pool :) </li>
      <li class="lesson">One of the things that I'm unhappy about is not being able to spend as much time on writing as I used to. Not that I'm not writing. I'm still writing plenty, just that most of my writing is either for business correspondence or preparing proposals that would lead to correspondence. This has been a novel experience so far but it does not give me that same sense of satisfaction. What I would like to do instead is more creative writing or writing about stuff that is not related in any way to work. Right now I've got about 6-7 drafts sitting idle just because I can't summon up enough strength to work them. The fact that I'm ignoring them should be telling. I must dedicate more time to writing because it's the best mental exploration tool I have. Mental exploration is necessary for me to make progress of any kind. I'm better when I write. More cheerful,more relaxed and more sure of my actions.</li>
      <li class="writing">I did write a progress report for Sam ahead of our call on 30. It's fortunate that I've had a good month. He might be impressed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">2 Dec 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The talk with Sam went well. He asked me to look into a few banks and, if I like them, he promised an introduction with people working there. The next call is on 14th so I have plenty of time to go through the list of banks. Maybe I can also polish some of my pitches before the call. </li>
      <li>I got in touch with Mandy again to discuss the  proposition I'm planning to write for the National Landlord Association.She suggests that it would be better for me to test the pitch with smaller landlords first before going to an organization. The idea is good in theory but I'm not building a product for small landlords any more. However the bigger organizations might still benefit form the banking services that we'll create. She has a point however. With smaller landlords I get multiple chances so if I can get them to think from the point of view of NLA maybe they'll have feedback to offer. Anyway talking can't hurt.</li>
      <li>I've started talking directly with government officials of different countries. The idea is that if I can pitch to them and make them see the usefulness of the proposal maybe they can help me execute it by making introductions to banks. One thing that's working in my favor is that most of these people are pretty accessible and open to innovation. They may take some time to respond but they usually do. I've just got to be patient and keep moving. I can't get restless or demotivated. </li>
      <li class="milestone">I got a response from the Director of Singapore Business Federation! It was a bit unexpected. He said that my paper was very informally written. True, but very few people read formal papers. Everybody has their own tastes I guess. Anyway, I responded to the email as formally as I could. If he likes my idea and agrees to help me, my position will greatly improve. I hope I can get lucky :)</li>
      <li class="people">Man Omkar is being trying these days. His problem is that he can't remain calm so every decision he takes is not quite right, I feel. For example he'd like to travel and he's already in Goa so this is a great opportunity for him, but he's too worried about finding a job. There's no way that he won't find one. He's a good dev. Plenty of experience and well lots of opportunities to be honest. But he should take some time off to find out in which direction he'd like to go. Otherwise even the next job will not satisfy him. I try to tell him this but he's simply not ready to be still and think. He's always preoccupied with this or that and then keeps on complaining!</li>
      <li class="people"> Yesterday I  met Sahil at New Sheetal. I almost didn't recognize him in his new beard. It seems that Rahul is here for a vacation and Sahil is going to show him around. Good for them. It's fun to take people around on trips. You get to relive the experience all over again through them and remember what you loved about the place when you first saw it. Anyway I went to their room at night. Everybody was present. Arun shaved his head again!
      </li>
      <li class="reading">I've started reading Twenty Thousand leagues under the sea. I need a change from all the gloomy philosophy books that I've been reading.</li>
      <li>Over all great week. Tomorrow I sit down and finish some old posts so that I can move on. </li>	  
    </ul>
    <p class="date">6 Dec 2016</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Ok so the director of SBF very politely indicated to me that I was building castles in air and that if I have some proven results he would be glad to assist me if not I should get lost. He also called me an Eminent Entrepreneur. That was very sweet of him (<3). Anyway the important thing was that I got a response. </li>
																																		 <li>Based on a semi positive outcome I proceeded to send emails to consulate of all the countries where fintech is hot. Half of them have responded. Since this plan seems to be working I will dive in deeper and contact accelerators at these places. All I need is one believer. The odds are in my favor.</li>	  
      <li>I need to mix things up a little. I'm felling dull doing this drudge work of sending emails all day. Maybe I should try cold calling? The problem is that international calls are very expensive. Lets see if I can find some attartive plans? Skype also allows international calls but I've heard the quality is pretty bad. </li>
      <li>Linkedin is getting a bit suspicious of me. They've started displaying a warning that I'm getting too many "I don't know this person" responses for my invitation requests. I need to cool it down for a while. On the plus side this could be an opportunity to strengthen existing contacts. </li>
      <li class="people"> Mommy dearest(<3) is planning to visit at the end of this month... this could mean trouble. She does not know that the apple of her eye (<3) has once more started on the path of eminent entreprenurship after quitting his job. And when she finds out that I'm "idiling away" in front of a computer instead of going to the office I'm afraid that my days of emiment entreprenaurship will be over. I need to think of a clever plan that explains everything. Or at the very least find a consulting assignment to show her that I'm not completely worthless. </li>
																				       <li>It might be worth it to find a consulting assignment any way. I don't want to run too low on funds. Also if I have some money maybe I can attend more conferences and gain some more connections. The one in Delhi was really helpful and it might pay off. I can't waste time in trying to convince an angel to fund me. Its better that I make some money on my own and keep moving forward. And frankly I need connections more than money. I should be able to take care of travel expenses on my own if I choose the destinations wisely.</li>							       
      <li class="people">Coming up on 14 is my talk with Sam. I need to give him a report on banks that he has suggested. To be honest I'm so desperate that I'll work with anyone who says yes. I'm not in a position to be selective. </li>
      <li class="writing"> In between I want to write an article that explains correspondent banking and ties it together with ideas of airline joint ventures and foreign embassies. I'm afraid that the pitches that I've written so far only show what can be done with the product once it's built. But people are skeptical whether the product can be built in the first place. This should clear all the doubts and put things into perspective.</li>
      <li class="writing">I'm working on my post on self reliance. Its coming out well but I think it'll take more time before I can publish it.</li>
      <li class="reading">I'm quite enjoying twenty thousand leagues under the sea. I don't know why I never read it before! I think it would make for a really good read on the beach. I should try that this week. </li>
      <li>When in doubt go straight and turn right.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li class="people">I have decided that I'll just come out and tell Mommy Dearest <3 (Here after referred to as MD) the truth. But only on the last day so that it does not affect her holidyas. She rarely travels and I'm not going to spoil this with unpleasent surprises.</li>
											  <li>I don't like to think about the future, because it always looks grim. I don't have an answer to what I'll do next. When MD asks me "what if I fail?" I can't just say that it'll be all right. She has heard it enough. I must show to her that I've got a plan and that everything is under control.</li>
      <li class="people"> I'm also going to message Tal on Hanukkah. Its going to be awkward, but whatever. I can't think anymore, I must do now. The only problem is I can't come up with anything clever to say...</li>
      <li> Being the Christmas season and all, I get a feeling that people are in a bit of a holiday mood. Any communication that I do this time will be ignored, as it should be. There are better things to do in life. So after I talk with Sam I'm going to slow down everything until new year.</li>
      <li class="people">And being the Christmas season, I can use this time to make amends with people. I say "people" because, well it isn't one or two fellas that I have to make amends to. It's a whole list. I've been a bad boy, but Santa's still packing gifts so if I can be quick about it I might get lucky!</li>
      <li class="lesson">And since I'm being honest about everything today, let me also admit that I've been reading all this Philosophy because I've been running away from the real deal. Trying to rationalize everything with nonsense. Hiding behind ideals is also cowardly. Sorry Seneca, but its true.</li>
      <li class="milestone">By the way I've been blogging for 4 years now. So that's one good thing. Never thought I'd be able to stick to it. But I did. Good for me.</li>
      <li>If I were running an accelerator all I would do is get founders' mothers unannounced in the office from time to time. That'll keep them on their toes and forever motivated.</li>

      <li class="people">Met with Pranav yesterday. Things are going as usual for him. They are moving back to Monte Carlo and will keep working from there. We talked about old stuff. It was good seeing him again, we made plans for a get tighter with the old team. A good time to be patching up on our differences. Much water has passed under the bridge.</li>
      <li class="people places">Omkar is fun! Met with him yesterday had breakfast. First the conversation took it's usual turn about plans for the future... I have come to accept that this is a part of small talk and we must get through the future before we can talk about the present. I told him my plans. He told me his. I shared my experience and he shared his. All went well. Then we suddenly decided to go a a mini trip to Ponda. Changed our mind midway and went to Bigfoot museum instead.  I was able to make it back for a call with Miguel in the Evening. Good times :) His mom is coming on Friday so I probably won't be seeing him any time soon.</li>
      <li> Just when I thought that things were going to get slower, I've got a week full of meetings. I'm not complaining, just that I don't understand. Being the holiday season I'd expect people to you know relax and have fun and be in a little "I can't care about his right now" type of mood. But things are going as usual. Okay.</li>
      <li class="places"> Arambol is much better in the night. Went there a few days back and stayed around for the live music outside the bar.The band played covers for "Blue suede shoes" and "Road house blues" and many others that I could not recognize. It was a good performance.</li>
      <li>The talk with Sam got postponed. No worries though I'm prepared and we can do it any time we want.</li>
      <li>Overall things are still hard in the sense that I moving very slow and I'm not sure what will be the result of the effort that I'm putting in. But at least I've got something to do. That's good.</li>
      <li class="milestone">From May to December I've sent in excess of 1000 emails. And I'm not planning to slow down anytime soon.</li>

      <li class="people">Shijin came back to Goa. He had contracted malaria so he went back home to recover. Thankfully it was very mild and he got better within a week. Anyway he's back now and has already started going to work. Its good to have him around.</li>
      <li>In the last few days I've been on call with many people to discuss an opportunity for some kind of collaboration. Of all the places I've had best response from Romania and Hungary. Neither of these are fintech popular countries but they could be good for me because they want to establish a fintech presence. Which means that they are more open to applicants. Where as in other places fintech startups are dime a dozen. So I have to really stand out to even get a chance for an interview. Any way,like I said, I'll work with whatever I get.</li>
      <li class="people">So the talk with Sam got postponed again. It's supposed to happen today and I hope this time we talk and not postpone it anymore.</li>
      <li class="lesson">Often I do think of quitting and searching for a job again. Its so much easier, you don't have to worry about anything else but your work. I don't understand why people whine so much. I guess one of the benefits about trying to run your own business is that you get to experience the really hard stuff, so all the other difficulties become insignificant in comparison. Its like training in 99G.</li>
      <li>The problem with me is that I start to fee a bit suffocated in a job. It gets really numbing after a time doing the same kind of stuff over and over. I need a bit of variety in work. So if (or when) I look for a job again I'm going to make sure that I have some room for creativity. Either in the work (which I think would be very unlikely), or in the form of time availability for other pursuits.</li>
      <li class="lesson">Again and again I've regretted putting all my eggs in a basket. But I don't seem to learn anything from the failures. This is just pig headedness. I must not decline work when its made available. I must always have a couple of good solid projects in the bag that I can fall back upon when it gets tough (and it invariably does).</li>
      <li>Overall life is good, only that I don't know where its headed. Which is exciting when everything is going well, but not so exciting when it's not!</li>
      <li>The festivals are approaching and I can sense positivity in the air. The streets are decorated. At night there are lights all around. Everything feels vibrant.</li>

      <li class="people">Talked with Sankaran today. He's also working on his startup full time. Things are much more difficult for him than they are for me.  Being a father to a baby girl I can't imagine the self belief it would take for him to give up everything and work on a startup. He's an inspiration. Although I'm disappointed that he can't work with me (I really wanted him) I do want him to be successful. He deserves it. The good thing is we can exchange notes and give each other advice on how to keep going. Even though we are not working together it feels as if we're in the same boat.</li>
      <li class="people"> I also gave a call to Mohit today and it seems that he won't be able to work with me as well. He's found an opportunity in Netherlands and he'll be pursuing that. I don't blame him. I would have done the same thing myself. But like Sankaran he's an exceptional programming talent and would have been an asset if he had agreed to join. But he did say that he didn't know how things would turn out in the future. So I guess maybe some other time under different circumstances he might join me. That would be good.</li>
      <li class="places">Yesterday I went to Serendipity Arts Festival. I learnt that the real Abbe Faria was a Goan. I only knew "Abbe" as the guide/teacher to Edmond Dantes in the novel "The count of Monte Cristo" who not only got a dejected Edmond back on his feet again but also told him about the hidden treasure that would make him powerful and rich beyond measure.I was quite thrilled to discover the Goan connection with the Count of Monte Cristo. I guess I was here in Goa only to discover this truth.</li>
      <li>I got introductions to a couple of Swiss fintech accelerators. The swiss contact in DIT was very helpful. Not only did she get in me in touch with her contacts in India she also reached out to her personal connections in Switzerland. Whether I get something out of these introductions or not, I'm very thankful to her for helping me out. These unexpected favours are a confidence booster that encourage me to keep going.</li>
      <li> I'm also thinking about moving back to ggn. There's nothing much left to do here in Goa and it would probably be better if I stayed at home. Plus there's a meeting with Sam in Delhi on 16 Jan so I don't want to keep shuffling between two places. It gets tiresome.</li>
      <li>My chess puzzle rating is falling. I'm definitely getting duller!!</li>

      <li class="people"> Over the last couple of days I caught up with old Friends. It was good to know that they are doing well. I talked with Saurabh and I'm planning to go to his place when I'm in ggn. Its been a long time since we saw each other, but that will make it all the more better. </li>
      <li class="people places">
	I spent the weekend at Shijin's place. He cooks well. I lent a hand by doing the dishes :P. On Christmas afternoon we went to the ruins of St. Augustine church and Our lady of Rosary church. Unfortunately the christian art museum was closed.

      <li class="people"> Arun is still in Chennai. When I called him he was in a hospital -- his sister in law was about to deliver a baby. He told me that he was going to be a "Father in law soon". I asked him if he meant an "uncle" and he responded with "yes, whatever". I caught up with him the next day and it was a boy. He was really happy :)</li>
      <li class="lesson">I realized something about myself as well. When my self confidence meter is running a bit low I generally accept the opinion/"advice" of others without putting in much of a fight or a counter argument. It has been one of the reasons that I've quit so many times on things that I wanted to do. Now that I know this, one of the countermeasures can be to simply let some time pass before arriving at a decision. Something like "sleep over it"</li>
      <li> As far as I can tell I've tied all the loose ends in this past week. Fixed all the mistakes I've made. The way I see it year is drawing close to a fantastic finish. If only I can get MD on my side I can have a much better 2017. I guess this is going to be another one of those nail biting finishes!</li>

      <li class="people">I've been approached for a new consulting assignment by Hatim. It was a project that Omkar was working on previously, so I caught up with him to get some info on what to expect. Apparently its a magento based web application and they need help with some front end work. I'll take a look at what needs to be done and then decide whether to accept it or not. I will accept it if its pure front end. But I'm no good with magento and, well, I don't see any benefit in learning it. But still, I'll be open minded about it and if its something I can pick up quickly I won't say no.</li>
      
      <li class="people">I must say that once more luck has shined upon me. Just a couple of days back I was struggling to put together a reasonable excuse that I can give to MD when she figures out that I'm not going to office these days. I just can't tell her that I'm working on my startup. That won't do. First of all she won't understand what "the idea" is all about and I suppose I'll loose my argument when the discussion (inevitably) turns to the question of money. She'll have me admit that I'm un employed. She'll have me acquiesce that I'm just wasting my time with "idle chit chat" on email when I should be brainstorming with a team. I tell you with all seriousness, she's more ruthless than a VC. Anyways, I wanted to show MD that I've work.That I'm not sitting idle. That I'm a responsible person who knows that things don't go always like one expects them to and being cognizant of this fact, I refrain from taking unnecessary risks. That I'm not a fool, I go steady and I'm confident in myself because I've a secure source of income. Moreover apart from doing my work, for which I'm paid, I'm trying to set up a business of my own so as to secure my future. It seems that with this unforeseen blessing from the great soul up above in the sky, now I'm in a position to put my side of the story in a way that will appeal to her. Even if this project is not the the kind of thing I like to work on, it is something. And something that I can show MD is better than nothing. O lord, I thank thee from the bottom of mine heart for the kindness bestowed upon thine humble servant.</li>
      <li>Over the last couple of days I've also been talking to my former colleagues to see if they'd like to work with me on wrinq. The general response was a yes. So I think I have a team that can support me if I can get to an accelerator or gain access to a banking partner. Its an encouraging sign for me.</li>
      <li class="reading">After many weeks I actually enjoyed reading a book. It was some gibberish by Chesterton. I forget what he was rambling about, but I laughed at his little jokes.. I took frequent breaks from reading so that it could last a little longer. And when I finished I put the phone back into my pocket and took a walk by the sea and wondered how could I have forgotten these things that I used to enjoy so much? I must have done something wrong along the way.</li>
      <li class="people">The president of Swiss Finance and technology Association wants to have a chat with me. I mean, I can't say no when a person asks politely. OH YEAH BABY, LETS HAVE A CHAT !!!!</li>

    <p class="strong">Resolution for 2017: I'll make life easier for myself.</p>
    <p class="date">14 Jan 2017</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a good mystery the focus is always on the investigation, never upon the investigator. Sure Sherlock Holmes is an interesting character, but he's only interesting as long as he's observing and deducing. House is most compelling during the diagnoses of his patients. There's a reason why M. Poirot and Miss Marple were old invalids. A detective can't be an enigma, but everything else may be. The mystery should be so gripping that the detective may be forgotten entirely. 
      </li>
      <li>A detective may be appealing outside of his profession but that appeal exists only because of his profession. Sherlock Holmes and Dr House, with their adventurous natures are  somewhat noteworthy. M. Poirot is not. But in the context of story, within the confines of the puzzle every detective is on the same footing, struggling to make order out of the chaos. The two divergent thoughts here are -- that  a detective is always compelling after he has emerged victorious from the cast of befuddled characters. But he may or may not be anything to talk about outside the realm of the mystery. I'm not really sure how many people would want to read about Sherlock's achievements on the classification of Tobacco ash without first reading about the Adventure of the Engineer's thumb.</li>
      <li>Between the extremes of a good mystery and a good romance there have been all kinds of books that make sacrifices on one end and compensations on the other. For example the Tommy and Tuppence series by Agatha Christie were more romantic than they were mysterious. So while its easy to say that there are no rules in writing it's hard to actually follow through in such a liberal manner. If you try to make a detective an enigma you've got to divert the entire narrative to solve him.And once the detective has been solved he must be thrown away. On the other hand if the puzzle lies elsewhere, a detective can be no more interesting than a piece of paper but still manage to captivate the audience by producing a solution. Then all his annoying eccentricities become lovable traits. He's adored for torturing street dogs in his experiments. His gun shots decorate the wall like medallions. His perversion with dead bodies is seen as a mark of scientific temperament. His compulsion of having all the facts about everything in existence is not a sign of mental illness but that of an intelligent temperament. </li>
      <li>Too many detective stories have been either all dark or all light. So that if a detective story is going to be funny it'll be funny by making fun of the detective. Portraying him as a lovable fool who can't even tie his own laces, let alone catch the diamond thief. In some cases the roles are reversed, where the sidekick is more intelligent than the lead. Murder can't be funny so the easiest option is to laugh at the investigator when he falls into the gutter while running after the suspect.</li>
      <li>There definitely are rules in mystery writing, any kind of writing, that can't be broken as they enforce themselves automatically upon anything that is written. Now there is a lot of flexibility as long as you don't break them but the only way to properly break those rules is by writing coherent non sense like Keeler did. </li>
      <li>I'm writing all this because I watched Detective Byomkesh Bakshi yesterday. I loved it so much that I want to go to Kolkata now! I feel that India has been terribly underutilized as a setting for detective novels. There's mystery pouring out of every street. Maybe someday.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, I'm taking things a little slow now. On the business side it's a very desperate situation. In 9 months I haven't been able to get into an accelerator/ convince a bank to partner with us. I hardly get any replies to emails, such total indifference is hurtful to the soul. I've started to gather together my material to  "donate" it to a few people who I think can execute this. The problem is that no one is really interested. Anyway what I'm hoping is that maybe I'll get yes from one of these people and we'll be able to work together on this. It'll be fun, I guess.  </li>
      <li>I still have a couple of lines open. Travelex innovation department has shown interest in talking to me and I've a presentation at the startup bootcamp event in Delhi. Besides that I don't have any moves left. In my heart I'm still hoping for a last minute miracle. I mean, either I'm a colossal fool working on this, or I've stumbled upon something special. And the suspense is killing me.</li>
      <li>I've also polished up my resume and applied to a few jobs, lets see what comes of that. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">22 Jan 2017</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="people"> I got a no from both Mumbai and Singapore startup bootcamps. I been very naive dealing with them. It should have been clear from the first few calls that they have to do a job and they'll do whatever it takes to get me attend their events and fill up their little forms. They deal with 100s of startups everyday and they have to be polite and encouraging towards them all. They have their own business to run and it's in their best interest to select startups that are most likely to give a return on their investment. But the problem is they have no hesitation in leading people on, until they make up their mind. A friend of everybody is a friend of nobody.</li>
      <li class="lesson"> But whatever has happened has happened. I'll be a lot more smarter for this experience but I need to move on and keep my focus. After all, everybody lies. Am I right Dr House?</li>
      <li>What I need to do now is go back to the drawing board and figure something out that I can start on my own. I can't sit around waiting for a bank to back me up. The higher goal was to build services that allow businesses from seemingly unrelated domains to collaborate with each other. How can a telco and a hotel network work together? Banks played a role in this plan but I guess if I rely on them in the initial stages I'll get nowhere.</li>
      <li id="combank_prop_search">I found a couple of interesting things that have started turning my wheels again. Like for example, there is a property search application backed by the Commonwealth bank of Australia. Now why would a bank would have anything to do with a property search app? It's all about getting hold of a network of services. I was right in my initial analysis but wrong in my approach.

      </li>
      <li>I have a call coming up with travelex innovation department on Tuesday and I've fleshed out an idea that I think they'd like. I know that the chances of a partnership are slim as I don't have anything to give them but I'll present my case as well as I can. I've got to think like a lawyer representing his client.</li>
      <li>The thing is, if I quit now I won't ever be able to read Chesterton without feeling a bit ashamed. Honestly I wish I had never come across his work.I don't know what I was thinking when I picked up his essays. Looking back, I guess it was one of those black days in my life. He puts bad ideas in my head. Fat Old Bastard!</li>
      <li>But a man's got to know his limitations. If I can't do a thing it must not mean that the thing won't be done. I am collecting my notes and my research and showing it to people who can do stuff with it. Met an IIT professor of economics in the startup bootcamp event and he quite liked the concept. I'm asking for his help to reach out to the government. 
      </li>
      <li>Reading a book is not a causal thing like I used to think it was. It's not entertainment but a fight to death. A book can burn you. I don't think that it was wrong for people in the old ages to burn the books.Because either you burn the book or the book burns you. From now on I'm going to limit my reading time.</li>
      <li class="places">Meanwhile I'm in ggn and, well, feeling quite cold. It's a drastic change from the nice sunny weather in Goa. Already I've gotten a runny nose and a bit of a cold. But to be honest I was missing the winters :)</li>
      <li class="people">Went to Lalit's place yesterday. He is gotten far in his preparation for IAS. He had an interview for the post of Assistant General. Did well from what I could gather. The work he's done over the years is starting to pay off. Even if he does not make it in the public service, he has accumulated a  much knowledge over every subject imaginable that he can put to good use. We discussed a few business ideas, he's more interested in ideas dealing with physical products but the problem is we need significant capital investment up front. He has some good thoughts. I shared my experience with him and suggested that he should talk with more people about his plans. Who knows what might come out of it?</li>

      <li class="people" id="sau_excuse">Saurabh got away with excuses. On weekends he had to go for french classes. On weekdays he was too busy with his work and on public holidays he had other plans. Tried contacting Sunny as well, but no reply. I guess no point in pushing this. And well, I suppose, I deserve the cold shoulder.
	Maybe we'll get to meet when the <a href="#sau_holi">time is right</a>.</li>
      <li class="people places"> Went to the Delhi National museum with Alok and Anirudh. Found out that there are a Couple of Indus Valley Civilization sites in Haryana. Made plans to visit them some day. It shouldn't be more than a few hours of bus ride from ggn.</li>
      <li class="people">Anirudh and I have started plotting again. Once more we have to start from scratch but its best if you keep moving. Its good to be banging head with him.</li>
      <li class="people">Had a talk with Arun about new plans. He won't say no outright but I don't think he's much interested. Not his fault really, this stuff can get quite demotivating and there are enough problems in life already without making it any more complex. I won't hassle him but it would have been really good to have him on the team, in any capacity. Maybe when the time is right. </li>
      <li class="people">Talked with Rahul yesterday. He seems quite interested in working with us. He's brainy and he can program. So he's in.</li>
      <li class="people">Miguel gave me an opportunity to write a proposal for EU commission research and innovation program.The deadline is 15 Feb. The only thing I need to be careful about is the language I use. Don't want to ruffle any one's feathers, honestly (BAH! HUMBUG!). Seriously though, I'll be polite, formal and to the point.</li>

      <li>I feel that writing a diary entry is a very lazy form of writing. You don't have to think much just blurt out ordinary things happening day after day.But still some writing is better than no writing so untill I can get myself to think more I should be sticking with this form.</li>
      <li>It does have some benefits though. It serves as a good tool to dispose off your thoughts.So you can start thinking fresh and review things at your convenience. Like Dumbledores <em>Pensieve</em> where he used to collect all of his looping thoughts in a basin and was able to play the old stuff any time he wanted. One session, with about 15-20 minutes of writing will leave you feeling light as a feather ;-) </li>
      <li>Watched Escape from Prison Alcatraz a couple of days back, and well it seems that ShawShank redemption borrowed quite a few things from it. While Count of Monte Cristo is probably the greatest prison break story ever I think that Escape comes in a close second. </li>
      <li>I'm also planning to write a post on Tin Tin. I've watched the movie atleast 5 times now and still it feels as good as new. I loved how it managed to capture the spirit of adventure. Infact I think I like it more than some of the Indian Jones' movies. </li>
      <li class="lesson">I found out that you can map a wildcard subdomain on an IP address. I used to wonder how these hosting websites created subdomains on the fly. It is a bit of a breakthrough for me, as I can do so many things with this little peice of information.</li>

	So I was talking to MD(<3) about how she knows all these things about cooking and stuff and she tells me that she studied this subject called home science in college. She had told me that many times before but I never paid it much attention back then. But now this knowledge has a special significance. I must study this obsuce subject and master all the spells contained within it's ancient text. I need improvement in every area but especially in cooking. I can't eat burnt potatoes all my life. On a full stomach a man can do anything.

      <li class="places">I came back to Goa on 13 Feb. There was some stuff left behind that I had to take back. Day before yesterday, I shipped away my scooter, and I'm in the process of packing rest of my things.  My tickets are booked for 3rd March. I could have left today but I thought what the heck, lets have two more days :) </li>
      <li class="people"> Arun took me to Aunty's last Tuesday. Things went better than I expected. She was a bit cross for a few moments but then things went back to normal. With all the teasing and little jokes between us any hint of awkwardness vanishes. She invited me for her special <em>Neer Dosa and chutney</em> treat on Monday, it was amazing. I had forgotten how good she cooks. I'm definitely going to miss her food.</li>
      <li class="people">I've talked about my idea of an app for <a href="/business/marketing-landlords.html"> people in the housing</a> industry with a few friends. Everybody is interested but no one wants to put in the work. With one the discussion ends with a debate on tech, with another there are personal problems and yet another feels too tired to work after office. I think I should put the idea of having a team out of my head and instead focus on solving the problem on my own. Coding wouldn't be hard. But marketing will be. Therefore I've to adjust my goal a bit. I'll focus on building something that I can personally show to people and ask them for their feedback. Luckily there are a lot of people in housing industry that are easily approachable. And given the "training" I've had trying to get in touch with the people in banks I think I should have a much easier time with landlords and property managers. Plus if I can get an app on the store my chances of discoverablity increases many fold. Furthermore my <a href="/research/hotels.html">research</a> on the subject is coming along well. All I need to do is be patient and keep working on it. If I can do that I'll be in a very good position.</li>
      <li>I've contacted Sabre api team to see if I can use their api to book airline tickets from my app. Although I don't expect much, but if I can get the access to their services, it would make it much easier for me to get the users. Once I have users I can maybe even direct them to try out some of the properties on our platform. But still I will develop the application from the point of view of property managers first and foremost. Because they'll be the ones who'll pay me money. Once that is done I can think about getting other users on the platform who can buy directly from the app, as a value addition for the home owners. It's a long shot but worth a try.</li>
      <li class="people"> Gaurav messaged me on Sunday, out of the blue. It was fun talking with him after such a long time, 3 years almost if I remember correctly. He's planning to come to Goa with Mohit on 9th March. Unfortunately I won't be here at that time. However I'll tell him about all the best places he can go to. I hope he enjoys his trip.   </li>
      <li class="places"> I'm quite enjoying these last few days. I don't go out much. Just to jetty first thing in the morning and the last thing in the night. A couple of times I went for a walk in the streets of Dona Paul. Those that face the sea have very beautiful houses. Some alleys have an exotic view of the jetty. From these places it seems like a Greek temple in the middle of the sea. I don't think I'll ever see a more beautiful place in my life. Beautiful sunrise. Beautiful sunset. A small quiet beach. Colorful homes on the hill and in the valley. And a serene atmosphere in the night, with it's gentle, cool sea breeze that prepares you for a perfect sleep.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="date">5 Mar 2017</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="places">All right. So I'm back in ggn. The weather is nice but the summer is just around the corner. It's going to get hot really soon. But it feels good to be back. I'm definitely going to miss jetty though.</li>
      <li>I've decided that from now on I'm going to write everything down so that I can keep a track of the events that lead me to make a certain decision. Every once in a while I'll retrace my steps to see how I got where I am and maybe even try to imagine alternative routes that I could have taken that might have lead to a different result. The idea is to completely eliminate repeated questioning about the choices that I make. Since I often forget the circumstances in which I took a decision it's quite natural to doubt my judgment especially if any particular decision does not lead to a desired outcome. When I have all the evidence at my disposal, that I can look up at any time I want, I don't have to waste any mental space about remembering anything. I can just focus on the present. In other words self questioning only occurs during writing. If I'm not writing I will not question my self or my actions. It'll be all reflexive/spontaneus/automatic. In other words I'll not think when I'm doing a thing. I'll only think when I'm not doing anything. </li>
      <li>Of course it goes without saying that I should have enough faith in myself to know that I'll make the right choice without even thinking. Or even if I don't make a right choice at a given time I have enough data to correct my course should I choose to do so. I don't have to seek advice from anyone. It's one thing to watch and learn and quite another imitate and follow.</li>
      <li>What follows from above is that I should always be ready to take action one way or another. No moments of indecision. If I fail I'll discover why I failed. If I succeed... well I guess then I'll be too happy to be bothered with the whys and the hows. </li>
      <li class="people">On that note I must begin by admitting that I've been acting selfishly of late. In discussing my ideas with Arun, Rahul, Anirudh and others maybe I've been asking too much of them. Their reasoning about our effort going to waste and eating up time that can be used in other pursuits (entertainment, relaxation or personal projects) is perfectly valid. The effort probably will go to waste. And if that is the case then its for the best its not their effort that is wasted. Personally I don't feel that effort ever goes to waste but everybody has different priorities in life, I suppose (look at me talking all sage like :P). And frankly I think that they are fools to not see the big picture but I can't help it. A no is a no. Live and let live. </li>
      <li>On the other hand I've a very talented group of people around me. It would be a shame for it to go all waste. While I can't ask too much of them I can't also let it all go. Therefore I've decided that I'll start on my own. Build a momentum and keep them in the loop. All of them have an automatic entry in should they chose to do so. </li>
      <li class="reading">Finished "Laches by Plato" in the train on my way back. Lately the dialogues of Plato are feeling a bit incomplete to me. Laches for example explores the idea of courage. People in the dialogue try to define what it means. Socrates finds contradictions in everybody's statements but he never gives an appropriate answer himself. All laches manages to do is raise questions. It's just another tease.</li>

      <li class="people places writing"> Met with Anirudh at Tau Devilal Stadium yesterday. Had a debate about how we should execute our plan. He suggests that I should go about it in order. That is I should build the app first and then build marketing/communication channels around it. I feel that I can build the communication tools very easily and maybe even make some money out of it by selling them as a service to our target audience. Building the app is going to take a long time where as building these helper tools (that can be sold) will not only allow me to lay the foundation, that will make my job easier later on, but it'll also help me to start communication with people who can later on become clients of our main application or can help with with introductions/referrals that can help us win other clients. I'll be preparing <a href="/study/hotels.html#q_a">answers</a> to all of his objections and then discuss the matter with him again. Meanwhile I've already started working on the app.</li>
      <li class="reading"> I finished "The defendant" by GK Chesterton day before yesterday. Over and over again I promise myself that I won't be reading any more of this Chesterton and Plato and all these clever guys because it messes with my thinking, but what can I do? I don't have any self control when it comes to reading. The reason I like Chesterton so much is that he is such a sharp observer of elitism and intellectual superiority of the so called "thought leaders" and he so effortlessly exposes falsity of their claims. Of course one is free to set aside all his arguments. But one thing is certain, after reading Chesterton you definitely start to think differently. He is good with words and sometimes it does feel that some of the assertions that he puts forth are not substantial on their own but when taken together as one they make his stand almost impossible to refute. I've also found it a good exercise to try to beat him at his own game. One weakness that writers like Chesterton have in common is that they have written so much and they have tackled such variety of subjects that their core ideas and themes start to thin out and are left open to attack. If you read enough of any writer you'll find lots of contradictions, holes in their arguments that are easy to exploit. But of course this kind of an attack is unsportsmanlike like. Because you can't do justice to any subject that you're writing about if you are adamant to shove your principles in it. So when Chesterton writes about something you can't really say for sure whether he actually believes what he writes. Everybody lies is sound advice when it comes to critical thinking. I'm learning to enjoy philosophy without taking it too seriously.</li>
      <li id="prog_s_gain">I'll have to learn redis and docker. It might get a bit too much for me. But I should be able to manage if I stick to the principles. And what are the principles? Speed of execution is most important, if I have to choose between an easy way and the right way I choose the easy way. And before we start a debate, this principle only applies to programming. More specifically my style of programming. Even the simple principles have thousands of points of conflict. Who defines what's easy? Isn't easy just one of those fleeting feelings? What's looks easy now will make things hard later on etc, etc. Well all I can say is this:- Exception handling be damned, burn away the unit tests and destroy all modularity. Speed at all costs!

      <li>I got my scooter back. The delivery was a bit delayed, I had to call the office at Goa a couple of times but it came intact. No sign of any damage or scratches. I've not yet found the time to cut off the packaging. I'm planning to do it this weekend and maybe afterwords I'll get it serviced once. The "old horse" served me well in Goa and I feel that there is still a lot of life left in it. I'll get it cleaned and oiled and use it here in ggn as well. Though I don't like driving here because there is too much traffic and anyways public transport is more enjoyable and productive  (If you travel in a bus or a train you can use that time to read, think or just observe the scenery and people) But still it can come in handy so it's best that I keep it in top condition.</li>
      <li> I bought 8Gb of ram for my laptop. I was testing a few apps on phonegap and I noticed the processes constantly ran out of memory and had to rely on swap. Also I believe that an upgrade was long due. I bought this laptop back in 2012 so it's been 5 years on the same configuration. I also got the fan replaced. It's a good time too because the summers are coming and it's going to get really hot around here. I will be using my laptop a lot and I would like the cooling to work properly. These two upgrades cost me around Rs 5K but they are a good investment. And since I'm with MD(<3), for now, my spending capacity has increased a bit. Don't have to pay the rent anymore!

	Lately I've been reading a lot of material on docker and the more I lean about it the more I like it.I also conducted a lot of small thought experiments around networking of containers and the <a href="/study/docker.html#prop_updates">concepts</a> that have come out of it can come in really handy in the future. The experiments were based on the idea that <a href="/activity-logs/index.html#prog_s_gain">I outlined before</a>. I will not care about best practices if they are hard to understand or take time to implement. I'll always choose the easy way out even if it's not optimal in the long run. Short term gains that build up momentum have a very important place in the long term product development. Anything that hampers the speed until a critical momentum is reached will be crushed. No unit tests, no logging, no exception handling (yes I can't even be bothered to write a try catch).My program will be bad but I'll always be aware of why its bad. It's not for everybody but it works for me. And since I'm the only one programming I don't have to answer to anyone. It's liberating in a way :) Also I'm working on little apps that can prove my concepts and if they do the development of MVP and of the product beyond that will be greatly simplified.

        <li class="people">Finally after 2 years I played Holi at home. What fun I had.It was a bit chilly on the day although the sun was quite bright. We woke up early, had breakfast and at around 9 and then gathered in the hall outside. The start is always a bit tentative. It takes a little time to get into the swing of things. So everybody was very gentle with their little strokes of color on the cheek. But all it takes to get into the full on party mode is a bucket of cold water emptied over an unsuspecting victim. This act signals a war. The party is immediately divided into two camps. One that is indignant of the injustice done upon an honest, upstanding member of the society and the other that is quite defiant and willing to break the rules to have some excitement in life. After a few minutes of a heated exchange everybody calms down and comes to the conclusion that we must stand united to serve the higher purpose of attacking the neighbours instead of each other. The highlight for me was the way in which I deceived Alok and let him straight into the trap. I went to his home, initially he could not recognize me so I had to introduce myself. Once he was satisfied with the credentials I put forth, he peeped out of the door only to be smeared in yellow. Later on I took him home on the pretense of replenishing our supply of gulal. And as soon as he climbed up the stairs I gave the signal to let the water loose on him. the plan could not have been executed better. After about 5 minutes of this treatment he pleaded for mercy and was relieved of this torture. I'm a benevolent person after all and I can't see anyone suffer .... for long :) </li>

But I found new achievable targets. I moving slow but I'm getting in the groove. The research I've done puts me in a very good position. I know this. And the best part about it is that I don't have to depend on anyone. No more begging banks to work with me. I can repurpose and reuse technology that is within my reach to create multiple sources of income independent from each other that would provide a ground for me to be able to attempt bigger things should I chose to. </li>

	I looked into <a href="/study/kubernetes.html#consider_this">kubernetes again</a>, after <a href="/study/kubernetes.html#docker_swarm">first deciding </a>to simply go with docker. Kubernetes does indeed simplify my architecture  but the most important benefit for me is from the perspective of devops. The google container engine gives you support of running k8 powered applications at the cost of number of compute engines used. So not only will it be a lot cheaper but also more easier for me to run k8 pods.   
      </li>
      <li> I gained another little victory with rearrangment of container components. Instead of having a single container handling all the components of a service I've decided to partition things. There will be a database container and then there will be an application container. Application containers will be spawned multiple times depending upon the request from the client but there will always be a single database container. This greatly reduces my resource requirements while at the same time giving me an architecture that is more manageable.</li>
        <li id="m_p_pool">One of my experiments with mongodb didn't give me the expected results. I put an nginx in front of it for proxy-ing tcp requests. The idea was that when I'll be connecting clients to mongodb they will be passing their requests through nginx in such a way that nginx will be responsible for managing client connections and mongodb will only be responsible for serving nginx. In other words mongodb will only have one client connection -- with nginx. Where as nginx will relay the response to other clients that are connected to it. However I could not make this work. I'll try again a few more things because if I manage to get this working it will be a <a href="/study/mongodb.html#proxy_pool">huge win</a> for me as I can reduce the number of concurrent connections to mongodb, however for now I've got other more important things to do. </li>
        <li>On the plus side I enabled an http proxy on mongodb so applications can simply access it over http. Once more this allows me to do all sorts of things remotely. Though I've to be a bit careful and expose the http proxy only to trusted clients. That is easily achieved with the help of <a href="/programming/mutual_authentication_systems.html">mutual authentication systems</a>. I already have the research done so implementing this should be a peice of cake.</li>
      <li>I woke up to a very beautiful day, today. The sight of blossoming Mango tree outside the window of my room filled my heart with hope. The tree only flowers every two years so this event is much anticipated by everyone. A good portion of the mangoes will be hoarded by our neighbours, they have the home advantage, but we do have  a couple of big branches extend on our rooftop. Even on a small section we there can be as many as 50 mangoes hanging down from it. Mother nature gives her love equally to one and all :) If the days ahead are not too windy we should have a bounty this season. And I've vowed to eat at least 40kg of them this summer!</li>
