        <li>Spent the day doing chores (cooked!, edited old posts) and answering emails.</li>
        <li class="reading">Tried reading but was too distracted.Watched Dr House instead.</li>

          <li class="people">Had a great breakfast (<em>kale chane and halwa!</em>). Anirudh cooks really well. </li>
          <li class="writing">Collected articles and reference materials for a post on Mutual Authentication Systems (MAS)
	  </li>
          <li>Went to the mobile repair shop despite the rains. Was relieved when the guy in charge accepted the warranty on the phone without making much fuss about the broken SIM slot. Hopefully the manufacturer will comply as well.</li>
          <li class="people">Anirudh got an SMS for jio sim activation. Couldn't figure out how to actually "activate" it .Wasted the entire afternoon running after the reliance representative, who in turn suggested that we call the customer care instead. The customer care could not be reached .</li>
          <li>Went for a walk in the evening. It rained. I got wet.</li>
          <li class="reading">Had dinner at Manipal. Answered some emails. Ended the day after reading Chesterton and Aristotle. </li>
          <li>Have decided that I'd finish everything by 11 PM and write the log before going to sleep.</li>
      </ul>

          <li class="reading">Started reading about corporate and investment banking in the morning. Had a headache by 11. Went out to get some bananas.They were heavenly.</li>
          <li>It rained all afternoon. Stopped for a little while in the evening. I managed to go for a walk without getting wet. </li>
          <li>Talked with guys from wescott capital. They suggested that I update my linkedin profile. I really want to do that,but it's boring to write about work related stuff. Maybe someday.</li>
          <li>It rained in the night. Got wet on way to dinner. Good thing I took my jacket.</li>
          <li class="people">Prepared a pitch for Prashanthi. She wanted "low hanging fruits" in corporate banking. The initial plan was low hanging enough. Was afraid that if I "lowered" it anymore the fruit might fall on the ground and rot. Therefore I added "low hanging" in the title and reworded the same pitch. I think it's good to go. Will find out tomorrow.</li>
          <li class="reading">Didn't read any good stuff. Will make up for the loss in the weekend.</li>
      </ul>

          <li class="people">The talk with Prashanthi went ok. She was very helpful though I get the feeling that they are not much interested in the ideas that we pitch, rather they've already got a set of problems that they want  solved. We're more like consultants/programming talent rather than founders. Which is perfectly fine, if they are upfront about it. Can't do much except hope for the best. Let's see how it goes.</li>
          <li class="reading"> It rained all afternoon just like yesterday.Couldn't go out for lunch so I decided to read instead. In all but 60 minutes Chesterton set my soul on fire! The man is incredible. If he were alive I would first like to box with him. Then I would want to debate with him. And after we've worked a sufficient appetite I'd like to dine with him,peacefully. Maybe listen to a few songs afterwords. He seems to talk about everything but music!</li>
          <li>The rain stopped for a while and I did go out for food. I was so hungry that I could have gladly eaten grass. Had American chop suey instead. Liked it. </li>
          <li>Slept in the afternoon. Went for a walk in the evening, enjoyed it thoroughly. On my way back I saw the full moon shining in the clouds. Occasionally it came out. Very beautiful scene. Could have easily watched it all night. </li>
          <li class="places">Went out for dinner as well. Had curd rice. After that I went to Lillie's and treated myself to a Groovy Judy milkshake (papaya+pineapple). Shouldn't have had it. Will probably have trouble sleeping tonight :)</li>
          <li class="places">On my way back I stopped at the jetty. They moon was quite high by then. Stood at my usual place, just near the edge of platform with the watchtower. There were some fishermen there. It was high tide today, the waves were pretty strong. I really like that place though I don't come here as often I used to. Guess I'll move again somewhere close to it.  </li>
          <li>I won't be eating any Bananas for a month at least. I'll try other fruits. Probably start with oranges.</li>
      </ul>

          <li>Interesting last couple of days. First I got stuck with a programming related issue. I wasn't able to figure out why openssl could not read the ".rand" file when being called from openresty. Since nginx ran as root it should have had access to every file. It turns out that the worker process by default run as "nobody" and it didn't have sufficient privileges to write to the '.rand' file. The solution was simple enough, just had to add a single line of configuration but I wasted a lot of time on this. Anyway it's a breakthrough and the rest of the stuff is not too hard to do. Just time consuming.</li>
          <li> Then I had a very good debate on hacker news on our "Blue oceans for banks" proposal. Defending the plan against some of the critiques has given me even more ideas on how we can make this work. I'm more convinced than ever that we have a very good plan on our hands. And if we can get a banking partner to believe in it, it can become something big. Or in the worst case the concept can be executed by someone with more resources.</li>
          <li>I cooked today.... I've been acting a bit out of character lately. I think I need to take a break and do some self examination. There's something fishy going on upper floor. I get a feeling that the monkeys are about to revolt.
	  </li>
          <li>Lots of pending tasks.There's a possibility of a new consulting assignment coming through. Have to write pitches for corporate banking services and send them to the contacts. In addition there are a couple of posts that I'm planning to write. Might have to postpone some stuff or put in more hours. The best thing to do is get things done and not leave them hanging. Even if it's a bit uncooked(!). I can always comeback and polish some of the stuff that has already been done.</li>
          <li>I don't think there's any point to wait till bedtime to write a post in the log. Best to do it when I have the time/something noteworthy has happened.</li>
