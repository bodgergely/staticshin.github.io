	<li>Went to get the mobile repaired,the shop was closed.
	  Will have to go there again tomorrow,I guess</li>        
        <li>Spent the day doing chores (cooked!, edited old posts) and answering emails.</li>
        <li class="reading">Tried reading but was too distracted.Watched Dr House instead.</li>
        <li class="milestone">Finally started the activity log so the day was not entirely useless :) </li>

      <ul>
          <li class="people">Had a great breakfast (<em>kale chane and halwa!</em>). Anirudh cooks really well. </li>
          <li class="writing">Collected articles and reference materials for a post on Mutual Authentication Systems (MAS)
	  </li>
          <li>Went to the mobile repair shop despite the rains. Was relieved when the guy in charge accepted the warranty on the phone without making much fuss about the broken SIM slot. Hopefully the manufacturer will comply as well.</li>
          <li class="people">Anirudh got an SMS for jio sim activation. Couldn't figure out how to actually "activate" it .Wasted the entire afternoon running after the reliance representative, who in turn suggested that we call the customer care instead. The customer care could not be reached .</li>
          <li>Went for a walk in the evening. It rained. I got wet.</li>
          <li class="reading">Had dinner at Manipal. Answered some emails. Ended the day after reading Chesterton and Aristotle. </li>
          <li>Have decided that I'd finish everything by 11 PM and write the log before going to sleep.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="date">15 Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li class="reading">Started reading about corporate and investment banking in the morning. Had a headache by 11. Went out to get some bananas.They were heavenly.</li>
          <li>It rained all afternoon. Stopped for a little while in the evening. I managed to go for a walk without getting wet. </li>
          <li>Talked with guys from wescott capital. They suggested that I update my linkedin profile. I really want to do that,but it's boring to write about work related stuff. Maybe someday.</li>
          <li>It rained in the night. Got wet on way to dinner. Good thing I took my jacket.</li>
          <li class="people">Prepared a pitch for Prashanthi. She wanted "low hanging fruits" in corporate banking. The initial plan was low hanging enough. Was afraid that if I "lowered" it any further the fruit might fall on the ground and rot. Therefore I added "low hanging" in the title and reworded the same pitch. I think it's good to go. Will find out tomorrow.</li>
          <li class="reading">Didn't read any good stuff. Will make up for the loss in the weekend.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="date">16 Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li class="people">The talk with Prashanthi went ok. She was very helpful though I get the feeling that they are not much interested in the ideas that we pitch, rather they've already got a set of problems that they want  solved. We're more like consultants/programming talent rather than founders. Which is perfectly fine, if they are upfront about it. Can't do much except hope for the best. Let's see how it goes.</li>
          <li class="reading"> It rained all afternoon just like yesterday.Couldn't go out for lunch so I decided to read instead. In all but 60 minutes Chesterton set my soul on fire! The man is incredible. If he were alive I would first like to box with him. Then I would want to debate with him. And after we've worked a sufficient appetite I'd like to dine with him,peacefully. Maybe listen to a few songs afterwords. He seems to talk about everything but music!</li>
          <li>The rain stopped for a while and I did go out for food. I was so hungry that I could have gladly eaten grass. Had American chop suey instead. Liked it. </li>
          <li>Slept in the afternoon. Went for a walk in the evening, enjoyed it thoroughly. On my way back I saw the full moon shining in the clouds. Occasionally it came out. Very beautiful scene. Could have easily watched it all night. </li>
          <li class="places">Went out for dinner as well. Had curd rice. After that I went to Lillie's and treated myself to a Groovy Judy milkshake (papaya+pineapple). Shouldn't have had it. Will probably have trouble sleeping tonight :)</li>
          <li class="places">On my way back I stopped at the jetty. They moon was quite high by then. Stood at my usual place, just near the edge of platform with the watchtower. There were some fishermen there. It was high tide today, the waves were pretty strong. I really like that place though I don't come here as often I used to. Guess I'll move again somewhere close to it.  </li>
          <li>I won't be eating any Bananas for a month at least. I'll try other fruits. Probably start with oranges.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
          <li>Interesting last couple of days. First I got stuck with a programming related issue. Wasn't able to figure out why openssl could not read the ".rand" file when being called from openresty. Since nginx ran as root it should have had access to every file. It turns out that the worker process, by default, runs as "nobody" and apparently it didn't have sufficient privileges to write to the '.rand' file. The solution was simple enough, just had to add a single line of configuration but I wasted a lot of time on this. Anyway it's a breakthrough and the rest of the stuff is not too hard to do. Just time consuming.</li>
          <li> Then I had a very good debate on hacker news on our "Blue oceans for banks" proposal. Defending the plan against some of the critiques has given me even more ideas on how we can make this work. I'm more convinced than ever that we have a very good plan on our hands. And if we can get a banking partner to believe in it, it can become something big. Or in the worst case the concept can be executed by someone with more resources.</li>
          <li class="places">Went to Miramar on Sunday. Met with Shijin. It was nice. </li>
          <li>I cooked today.... I've noticed that I've been acting a bit out of character lately. I think I need to take a break and do some self examination. There's something fishy going on the upper floor. I get a feeling that the monkeys are about to revolt.
	  </li>
          <li>Lots of pending tasks.There's a possibility of a new consulting assignment coming through. Have to write pitches for corporate banking services and send them to the contacts. In addition there are a couple of posts that I'm planning to write. Might have to postpone some stuff or put in more hours. The best thing to do is get things done and not leave them hanging. Even if it's a bit uncooked(!). I can always comeback and polish some of the stuff that has already been done.</li>
          <li>I don't think there's any point to wait till bedtime to write a post in the log. Best to do it when I have the time/something noteworthy has happened.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="date">20 Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Good day today. Woke up early and got to work straight away. Completed the design of MAS. Just need to write a post to explain the steps involved in building such a system in a clear, concise way. I feel that it could also be a very good use case for openresty. Might be able to kill two birds with one stone.</li>
          <li>The client was supposed to email me the details of the server and cloudant instance. Didn't mail. Didn't call. I think I should not waste any more time waiting. Better to focus energies on other pending tasks.</li>
          <li class="places people">Anirudh decided that he wanted to travel today. So we left at 4 to Salim Ali Bird statuary. We didn't see any birds but we saw a lot of mangroves and crabs. Mangroves are really cool plants. Can grow in salty water and create a vibrant sub ecosystem consisting of a curious mix of marine and land  animals. They are very hardy and have developed useful survival mechanism like air tubes(called pneumatophores) coming out of swampy land that allow them to breathe even in excess of water. Besides that we also read that they have medicinal properties and the wood from their trunk can be used in furniture. I find them fascinating.</li>
          <li class="reading">Planning to read the dogood papers and Emerson before going to sleep.</li>
          <li>It's been almost a week since I've eaten a banana. I'm suffering from withdrawal but I must be strong. Go go go!</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="date">21 Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Well something just had to go wrong. Anirudh decided that he didn't want to work on wrinq anymore. I'm really upset. Don't know if I'll be able to make it all alone. Maybe I'll have to give up on the idea. But if I do I'd like to pass on whatever I've learnt.</li>
          <li> Not really sure what I should do next. Should I persist and persevere? or Should I let go and change course?Both choices look equally unappealing to me. </li>
          <li>I talked with my old landlord and asked if he'd consider letting me back again in his place. He agreed. I think I'll move. I like that place. It's very upbeat. Good positive vibes. I need some positivity at the moment.</li>
          <li> I tried to write a detailed plan for BBVA but it didn't come out as expected.
	    I'll keep working on it tomorrow. Let's just hope that tomorrow turns out to better than today.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="date">24 Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li class="people">The worst has passed, I believe. Anirudh is preparing to move on. I'm helping him as much as I can. He won't be continuing with wrinq but I guess it's all right.I've decided that I won't quit just yet. I have some good ideas that may be tricky to pull off but they are definitely doable. </li>
          <li class="places">Yesterday we went to the food festival. It was more like " things you prepare food with" festival. But we had fun. They were giving away free nachos, we tried all flavours! </li>
          <li class="ideas"> I've gotten an idea of adding an auto reload feature to restyskeleton. So that I don't have to deal with restarting nginx every time the configuration files change. I've already defined the directory structure so I think it should be simple enough. Lets see if I can make sometime to implement this. </li>
          <li>There is still a lot of stuff pending but I'm catching up slowly. If I can respond to emails and write a teaser to the pitch in the weekend I should be able to make a lot of progress in the coming week. Maybe things can even start to look up!</li>         
      </ul>
      <p class="date">25 Sep 2016</p>
      <li class="milestone">Released a new version of openresty skeleton today! Added a parameter that watches for changes in .lua and nginx configuration files and automatically restarts nginx if any change is detected. I think the application is now maturing nicely. I'll add tests in a later release but right now I'm pretty satisfied with the way it works. Since I made it I've created lots of quick and dirty openresty applications and I've noticed that my own productivity with openresty has gone up. Maybe it will help other people as well. I think it's a win win.</li>
      <li class="people">Arun came today to meet me after a long time,I was really happy to see him. He is planning to resign. Says he doesn't like working with those people. I suggested that he should put some effort into building up his profile on linkedin and angellist. He is a good developer. He has done good stuff but he should also learn how to showcase what he has done.On the plus side he has good spirit and I have no doubt that he will recover from any temporary set back. I'll help him if I can. Anyway comparing his situation with mine, I think that I made a pretty good move by leaving that place early.</li>
      <li>One of the best things that has happened in this week is that I've finally gotten my mobile back! This means that I can read books outside. On the downside I'll have to re install all those apps again. Also the second SIM slot broke again but the guy at the repair shop has agreed to replace it free of charge. Good fellow! I'll go there tomorrow and get it fixed once and for all.</li>
      <li class="writing">I'm planning to send out the new pitch that I wrote for corporate banking by Tuesday. For that I'll have to prepare a teaser. The problem is that I'll probably have to create two or three versions of the teasers that appeal to different contacts. If I can make a couple of them today and revise the pitch to give it some finishing touches tomorrow I think I'll be prepared by Tuesday.</li>
      <li class="writing">The post on mutual authentication systems seems to have been stuck. I'll try to complete at least the README for the code section by this week and get back to working on the post in the next one.</li>
      <li class="reading">Finally I've been thoroughly enjoying the dogood papers. I'm pretty much convinced that Ben Franklin was a big troll.</li>
      <p class="date">29 Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li class="peope">Anirudh left. He was supposed to leave today but he changed plans at the last minute. I dropped him at the bus stop in the evening. Sad to see him leave, but can't do anything about it.</li>
          <li class="milestone"> I moved to my old place as well. Shijin helped a lot in moving my stuff. Would have been really difficult otherwise.</li>
          <li class="milstone">I got an official confirmation of being accepted into the barclays accelerator yesterday. It's a bit bittersweet and I'm left wondering if Anirudh had postponed his decision by a week how different things would look now.</li>
          <li class="milestone"> I finished the README for "MAS" example with openresty. It's a little victory but it allows me to proceed with my "MAS" post.</li>
          <li>I officially started a new client project yesterday. Looking forward to see where this leads. Time to pick up the pieces and move forward.</li>

        <li class="milestone places"> I've been in Goa for an year now. And after all the travelling I've done it still feels fresh. It's a bit strange to note that despite Goa being a tourist attraction the locals here are reserved. The nature is welcoming, the people are withdrawn. I don't mind this at all as it leaves me free to do whatever I want.  </li>
        <li>Had to present to the Barclays team on Friday. Wasn't prepared so I gave a short impromptu speech on the business explaining the concepts in the simplest possible way. Overall I think I did well. The panel there asked a few questions which were not all that challenging, I felt. They asked about the technology stack, who is going to use this solution etc all standard and all generic. I guess they have to fill their quota of startups and they don't really care how they do it. I think I might actually make it. But then again I might not! If I do make it will I be able to do what I want? or will it be another uphill battle this time with the internal team?  Who knows?   </li>
	          <li>Already the episode with Anirudh feels like a distant memory. I'm back to my old ways and habits. Pitching to banks, presenting the concept to business who would actually benefit by it, writing articles, looking for consulting work to sustain myself. Some times it can get really hard but its worth it because at the end of the day, when all is said and done I feel good. And feelin' good is good enough for me :)  </li>

          <li class="milestone">In all this commotion, of the last couple of weeks, I almost forgot to mention that I've finally gotten my law degree. That's right, I'm a lawyer now. I can take my own cases as soon as I clear the Bar exam (should be a piece of cake). Look out Perry Mason! </li>
        <li class="lesson">The consulting assignment that I took is looking a bit rocky. I think I under-quoted and the things that I'm supposed to fix are completely broken. By that I mean the application is not even running. Always do due diligence. Lesson learnt.</li>
        <li class="lesson"> One thing that I've come to understand is that programming by itself is not all that hard. You do need a certain amount of skill that takes effort to acquire. But after that it's all about sticking to the fundamentals. Simplicity (even in its most complex form), testability (even in its most difficult to test form) and a dedication towards solving problems (not necessarily by means of programming) gets you really far. The last point is important. If one is not invested in solving the problem a program can't come out good. If one is only interested in solving the problem by means of programming the solution will be inefficient. Good judgment is a surprisingly underrated skill in programmers. But I believe that it's very important. As a means of training a programmer should look at the task of writing program as chore. Something that is to be done only when it must be done. Restraint is essential in all aspects of life.</li>
      </ul>

          <li class="milestone places"> Had a great day yesterday. Finished clients work by 10 PM and went to jetty for a bit of reading. Something possessed me thereafter and I decided to go to Anjuna. Got stopped twice for checking by the police. They are a bit strict these days, due to upcoming elections I guess. Came back to Panji by 2 in the morning had coffee at Aunt Maria's before heading back home. Couldn't sleep though! </li>
          <li class="lesson people">I have observed on many occasions how particular women are of their appearance. Take today for example. At the wee hours of the morning when a person should feel all spent and tired after the days work, with a crumpled shirt and a drained odour, there are these flowers. Watered, perfumed, immaculately trimmed chatting away without a care in the world. Fresh as lilies at dawn. Ordinarily I would indulge in such a spectacle and breathe in this sweet aroma of nature. I would also learn a lesson or two in grooming oneself and develop an understanding on the art of talking trifles. But at that hour, their presence only made me extremely conscious of my relative wretchedness. So much so that it almost spoiled my enjoyment of the delicious coffee. Were it not for an extraordinary amount of awareness regarding the time at which a fellow is supposed to look like a rag I would perhaps have shifted in some dark corner to hide my shame. As it stood, however, I was quite content to disregard this ill-timed display of a spotless glow as nothing more than silly vanity and got back to sipping my coffee while contemplating the deep mysteries of the universe.</li>
          <li> I'm starting to really enjoy my new,old place. So much so that I decided to break my banana fast and buy half a dozen to celebrate my renewed enthusiasm towards life.</li>
          <li> I have begun a deep study of how airlines work as a business. I'm learning a lot of cool new things and principles that can be applied to other businesses as well. Hopefully after this study I can create a much better plan of action. </li>
          <li> I've  created a separate page to capture all the ideas that I get. This way I can run some analysis on how long it takes me to go from the inception to the execution of a new thought. Will also help me keep a little sane, I guess. These wild thoughts of mine possess a demonic power leaving me restless unless I give them an audience. I can't deny their appeal but I can certainly schedule the hearing :) </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="date">16 Oct 2016</p>
      <ul>
           <li class="lesson">One of the things I've noticed is that whenever I "hoard" on my writing and try to save ideas before they are good enough to be written I write nothing at all. One of the reasons of starting with the activity log is to have a space where I can write really random and unconnected stuff on a day to day basis. It is important that I do that because if I don't the thoughts waiting to be written become too much for me to bear. They take a life of their own. I go a bit off in my head. Am I addicted to writing?</li>
          <li>Anyway, overall it were a hard couple of weeks because, well I made it hard. First I feel into the trap of trying to do too much at the same time, again. I tired to network on linkedin, write a pitch for airlines, juggle with a bit of consulting work and none of them came out as well as I expected. Once more I'm reminded how important it is to maintain focus.</li>
          <li> On the plus side the pitch was well received and I got a phone call with the surf air! It's on Monday and I'm outlining the theme of the talk. If I can get them I think it would be a huge validation for wrinq.</li>
          <li> On the not so positive note I'm getting a feeling that this consulting assignment is a bit of a dead end. The guy in charge is unenthusiastic about taking the thing forward. We had a hard, straight talk yesterday. I don't mind how slow it goes as long as I get my money and he does not waste my time. </li>
          <li>Going forward I'd like to put more energy working on ideas and concepts around wrinq and another business that I'm thinking about. Yes I need to focus, but I believe that focus needs to be renewed. If I work too long on a single thing my focus actually depletes. So it's better that I have one ambitious really long term goal and one immediately doable low energy plan. Like a jab,cross combo. So that I get a feeling of progress that gives me energy to keep working on the long term thing. </li>
          <li class="people">Thanks to Bhavya I finally got a reliance jio sim. No more internet troubles now!</li>
          <li>See you later alligator!</li>

      <ul>
          <li class="milestone">I got rejected by Barclays :( In this moment of pain and suffering I can't seem to summon that stoic strength of mine that has served me so well in many of life's tribulations.FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK GOD DAMMNIT FUCK. Some times good old swearing is better than bearing the calamity with a calm disposition. FUCK THIS SHIT I SAY!!!! </li>
          <li>However my resolve is now stronger than ever. I'll show them. There are a couple more opportunities worth exploring. I'll have to put all into it. Now it's victory or death.</li>
          <li class="places lesson"> Went to Aarambol yesterday to slay some demons. The place is a gutter. The sweet water lake is shit. Hippies everywhere smoking, drinking "having a good time". Can't believe I once obsessed over... how the memory deceives with it's false charms. Need to move on quickly. I've wasted much of my precious time sulking and brooding. Moving on in 3,2,1...</li>
          <li> Over the last couple of months, things are not going exactly as planned. BAD SHIT IS HAPPENING! I need to start doing things without any expectations and just trust the spirit in the sky. Starting to trust in 3,2,1....</li>
          <li class="reading"> These days I've been reading letters from a stoic. Nice change from Plato. The ideas are easier to grasp. The reading is pretty light. The lessons are deep. Seneca is my new BFF. Of course I still make time for a couple of dialogues every now and then. Just a few days back I finished Charmides. Didn't like it much. In non fiction(!) it's PG Wodehouse again. I need to laugh more or else I'll have a stroke. </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="date">24 Oct 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li class="places">All right so I'll have to go to Delhi to attend a few meetings. Booked the ticket for 30, should reach home by 7.Quite excited that I'll get to be at home for Diwali :) Haven't been able to celebrate with family for two years in a row now. Not proud of it!</li>
          <li>In the meantime I'll try to focus my efforts on preparing a good presentation. I've already noted down the points I want to talk about. I've already researched the topics. I just have to write the dialogue(How cool it sounds when I put it like that!) I'll have 5 minutes to talk. Will look to present the subject manner in the simplest possible manner.  </li>
          <li> Tomorrow I'll try a new style of working. I'm going to wake up early. Finish everything by 11. After that I won't be touching work. Rest of the day will be spent reading, planning and doing background stuff for the tasks that might come up ahead.</li>
          <li>While I can feel it in my bones that the idea behind wrinq will be a success, I think I underestimated how tough it will be to get started. These bankers are very stubborn and lazy and slow! No worries though. I guess that they will find out that I'm equally stubborn but not lazy and  definitely not slow. Evidence will show that on the contrary I'm quite fast. To a fault actually. Sometimes I feel that I need to slow down a bit! Tomorrow I'll try again wearing my lucky t-shirt.</li>
          <li>I'm very lucky that I developed a taste for Philosophy. I remember during my school days I never used to touch those kind of books. In fact I used to actively stay away from them. In those days it was only murder mysteries for me. Ah man the summer break used to be so sweet. Sherlock Holmes and some rain, what else does one need in life? But I tasted Philosophy at just the right time. Looking back if it were not for wise words of Socrates and Aristotle I probably would have taken a path that would have only lead to pain and suffering. I'm lucky in that respect, advice on life's most perplexing questions are within my reach. I just need to skim over a few paragraphs and cure any kind of bewilderment that inflicts it's curse upon everyone from time to time. </li>
          <li class="lesson">I've also decided that I'll be practicing more restraint in my life. Patience and temperance really are virtues. Thinking about virtues is easy but putting those ideas into practice in daily life is really hard. Self control is powerful but it takes a lot of inner strength to develop. Especially when there are few examples in front of us and the only people with such a mastery over themselves are the ones that we can only read about in books. But I'm not looking for absolute mastery. Just a cognizance of the times when I'm likely to slip is enough for me.</li>

          <li>All right lots to cover. Came to ggn on 30 as planned, had fun on Diwali. Went to startup bootcamp fasttrack in Delhi on 4th Nov. Had a good response there (purely based on novelty of the idea I suspect) but they don't start the program until March next year. I don't want to wait that long. My first impression is: I don't really see them all that enthusiastic. I understand that fintech is probably the most boring domain ever but one can at least pretend to be excited. It's gets tiring after a time putting in all that energy and getting nothing back in return. Whatever, I've stopped caring now. To make this work all I need is 1 believer. I just got to keep on pushing until I find one. </li>
          <li>Anyways, here's the exciting part. I found out that there was going to be a UK India tech summit in Delhi between 7,8 and 9. I jumped on the opportunity and registered myself for the event. It was a good decision. The summit had the who's who of the business world. Head of vodafone, Technology advisor of UK, Mayor of London, University directors, bank presidents etc. That's just what I wanted :) and I played my best game. Got the contact details of almost everyone who mattered.</li>
          <li class="lesson">It's important that when you go into these summits or business meeting or whatever, that you keep things simple. Don't try to "connect" with people when you first meet. I couldn't help but notice that some people really tired "win the people over" maybe out of civility, or a sense of fostering camaraderie. But in their ardour they don't consider the fact that based on the volume of people alone nothing of what they say will be remembered by the other person.And by holding them off with polite small talk you are just shutting down their brain so that when you do come around to say the stuff that actually matters they won't hear you. Here's what I do. I go in move two steps and stretch out a hand for a shake, introduce myself while the grip is still firm and then ask for a card to send them my plan. Takes 15 seconds and the other person does not have to expend too much mental energy trying to decide whether they like you or not. Don't give any room for things to get awkward. Respect their time and yours. Get the card and then get out. Don't get greedy.</li>
          <li class="lesson"> There's a possiblity that you might run into them again. And that would be a good time for small talk especially when there a boring session going on the stage. Nothing brings people together like being numbed by the same lecture. It's the best conversation starter there is.

          <li class="places"> Taj Palace itself was really good. Carpets everywhere, big halls, sunny outdoors,good food and scented bathrooms! Too bad I had to spend all my time inside conference rooms. But a good experience nonetheless.</li>
          <li>In between all this I've had lots of breakthrough ideas on how to proceed with wrinq. I've started reading ISO 20022 reference manual to understand how all this financial messaging works. On a side note I'm really appreciating XML (nice change from json) too bad that lua does not have an XSD validator. I came to know about RTGS systems which validates the concept. Now I can just point and say "see these things already exist" I'm building something just like that.</li>
          <li class="people">Alok is really unfortunate with Mobile phones. He had another one snatched from him. Poor guy. Next time I'm going to make him miserable until he gets an insurance (what can I do? Some people never learn). Also I must be a bit more careful myself.</li>
          <li class="lesson">Grammar is for losers. Smart people are stupid. Life is a paradox.</li>

          <li class="places lesson">Came back to Goa on 21 Nov in quite high spirits. My stay in ggn proved fruitful and I was successful finding a way forward for wrinq. I'm at a stage where even having a sense of direction to move in is quite an encouraging thought. With all the uncertainty, just putting little steps one after the other gives me a sense of stability. Even though I'm quite far from my goal if I can keep moving I'll end up with something. At this point I've stopped focusing on the one goal and instead started carving out a lot of small achievable targets. For example:- Sure I can't build an international banking service at this point. But can I get my idea in front of a Bank MD, or an innovation manager? Can I get feedback on the services from a prospect? Those things are easy and achievable. Every yes gives me more confidence. Even a no is useful as at least it gets me a new connection.I need to figure out more of these win-win scenarios for myself.  </li>
          <li class="places lesson"> I spent three days on Agonda. Rented a shack there. Now, I'm not being an irresponsible spend thrift going out on pleasure trips. Though I'd certainly like be an irresponsible spend thrift every once in a while :), it's just that there is no point for me to keep sitting in my room when nothing is happening. I write a proposal and I set in motion the correspondence with people who can either give me feedback/help me achieve my goals and then there is nothing to do but wait. These things take time and happen at their own schedule. I can't do anything at this point. The best I can do then is to take some focus away from work. And every time I do that one of the two things happen:- either someone replies to my correspondence giving me an opportunity to keep the discussion going or I comeback with even more new ideas and themes to explore. Which in turns open up an entirely new channel of communication with people that keeps me busy for a week.</li>
          <li class="places">I found a new place. There's a chapel on top of a small hill in Betul on the way to Cancona.Although that chapel is like every other Chapel, it's got a magnificent view of the sea from it's ground. Very beautiful.</li>
          <li class="lesson">By the way nothing is more refreshing than watching people have fun on the beach. One feels happy when one is around people who are happy. Also swimming in the sea is way better than swimming in a pool :) </li>
          <li class="lesson">One of the things that I'm unhappy about is not being able to spend as much time on writing as I used to. Not that I'm not writing. I'm still writing plenty, just that most of my writing is either for business correspondence or preparing proposals that would lead to correspondence. This has been a novel experience so far but it does not give me that same sense of satisfaction. What I would like to do instead is more creative writing or writing about stuff that is not related in any way to work. Right now I've got about 6-7 drafts sitting idle just because I can't summon up enough strength to work them. The fact that I'm ignoring them should be telling. I must dedicate more time to writing because it's the best mental exploration tool I have. Mental exploration is necessary for me to make progress of any kind. I'm better when I write. More cheerful,more relaxed and more sure of my actions.</li>
          <li class="writing">I did write a progress report for Sam ahead of our call on 30. It's fortunate that I've had a good month. He might be impressed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="date">2 Dec 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The talk with Sam went well. He asked me to look into a few banks and, if I like them, he promised an introduction with people working there. The next call is on 14th so I have plenty of time to go through the list of banks. Maybe I can also polish some of my pitches before the call. </li>
          <li>I got in touch with Mandy again to discuss the  proposition I'm planning to write for the National Landlord Association.She suggests that it would be better for me to test the pitch with smaller landlords first before going to an organization. The idea is good in theory but I'm not building a product for small landlords any more. However the bigger organizations might still benefit form the banking services that we'll create. She has a point however. With smaller landlords I get multiple chances so if I can get them to think from the point of view of NLA maybe they'll have feedback to offer. Anyway talking can't hurt.</li>
          <li>I've started talking directly with government officials of different countries. The idea is that if I can pitch to them and make them see the usefulness of the proposal maybe they can help me execute it by making introductions to banks. One thing that's working in my favor is that most of these people are pretty accessible and open to innovation. They may take some time to respond but they usually do. I've just got to be patient and keep moving. I can't get restless or demotivated. </li>
          <li class="milestone">I got a response from the Director of Singapore Business Federation! It was a bit unexpected. He said that my paper was very informally written. True, but very few people read formal papers. Everybody has their own tastes I guess. Anyway, I responded to the email as formally as I could. If he likes my idea and agrees to help me, my position will greatly improve. I hope I can get lucky :)</li>
          <li class="people">Man Omkar is being trying these days. His problem is that he can't remain calm so every decision he takes is not quite right, I feel. For example he'd like to travel and he's already in Goa so this is a great opportunity for him, but he's too worried about finding a job. There's no way that he won't find one. He's a good dev. Plenty of experience and well lots of opportunities to be honest. But he should take some time off to find out in which direction he'd like to go. Otherwise even the next job will not satisfy him. I try to tell him this but he's simply not ready to be still and think. He's always preoccupied with this or that and then keeps on complaining!</li>
          <li class="people"> Yesterday I  met Sahil at New Sheetal. I almost didn't recognize him in his new beard. It seems that Rahul is here for a vacation and Sahil is going to show him around. Good for them. It's fun to take people around on trips. You get to relive the experience all over again through them and remember what you loved about the place when you first saw it. Anyway I went to their room at night. Everybody was present. Arun shaved his head again!
	  </li>
          <li class="reading">I've started reading Twenty Thousand leagues under the sea. I need a change from all the gloomy philosophy books that I've been reading.</li>
          <li>Over all great week. Tomorrow I sit down and finish some old posts so that I can move on. </li>	  
      </ul>
      <p class="date">6 Dec 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li> Ok so the director of SBF very politely indicated to me that I was building castles in air and that if I have some proven results he would be glad to assist me if not I should get lost. He also called me an Eminent Entrepreneur. That was very sweet of him (<3). Anyway the important thing was that I got a response. </li>
          <li>Based on a semi positive outcome I proceeded to send emails to consulate of all the countries where fintech is hot. Half of them have responded. Since this plan seems to be working I will dive in deeper and contact accelerators at these places. All I need is one believer. The odds are in my favor.</li>	  
          <li>I need to mix things up a little. I'm felling dull doing this drudge work of sending emails all day. Maybe I should try cold calling? The problem is that international calls are very expensive. Lets see if I can find some attartive plans? Skype also allows international calls but I've heard the quality is pretty bad. </li>
          <li>Linkedin is getting a bit suspicious of me. They've started displaying a warning that I'm getting too many "I don't know this person" responses for my invitation requests. I need to cool it down for a while. On the plus side this could be an opportunity to strengthen existing contacts. </li>
          <li class="people"> Mommy dearest(<3) is planning to visit at the end of this month... this could mean trouble. She does not know that the apple of her eye (<3) has once more started on the path of eminent entreprenurship after quitting his job. And when she finds out that I'm "idiling away" in front of a computer instead of going to the office I'm afraid that my days of emiment entreprenaurship will be over. I need to think of a clever plan that explains everything. Or at the very least find a consulting assignment to show her that I'm not completely worthless. </li>
<li>It might be worth it to find a consulting assignment any way. I don't want to run too low on funds. Also if I have some money maybe I can attend more conferences and gain some more connections. The one in Delhi was really helpful and it might pay off. I can't waste time in trying to convince an angel to fund me. Its better that I make some money on my own and keep moving forward. And frankly I need connections more than money. I should be able to take care of travel expenses on my own if I choose the destinations wisely.</li>							       
	  <li class="people">Coming up on 14 is my talk with Sam. I need to give him a report on banks that he has suggested. To be honest I'm so desperate that I'll work with anyone who says yes. I'm not in a position to be selective. </li>
          <li class="writing"> In between I want to write an article that explains correspondent banking and ties it together with ideas of airline joint ventures and foreign embassies. I'm afraid that the pitches that I've written so far only show what can be done with the product once it's built. But people are skeptical whether the product can be built in the first place. This should clear all the doubts and put things into perspective.</li>
          <li class="writing">I'm working on my post on self reliance. Its coming out well but I think it'll take more time before I can publish it.</li>
          <li class="reading">I'm quite enjoying twenty thousand leagues under the sea. I don't know why I never read it before! I think it would make for a really good read on the beach. I should try that this week. </li>
          <li>When in doubt go straight and turn right.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="date">11 Dec 2016</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="people">I have decided that I'll just come out and tell Mommy Dearest <3 (Here after referred to as MD) the truth. But only on the last day so that it does not affect her holidyas. She rarely travels and I'm not going to spoil this with unpleasent surprises.</li>
<li>I don't like to think about the future, because it always looks grim. I don't have an answer to what I'll do next. When MD asks me "what if I fail?" I can't just say that it'll be all right. She has heard it enough. I must show to her that I've got a plan and that everything is under control.</li>
        <li class="people"> I'm also going to message Tal on Hanukkah. Its going to be awkward, but whatever. I can't think anymore, I must do now. The only problem is I can't come up with anything clever to say...</li>
        <li> Being the Christmas season and all, I get a feeling that people are in a bit of holiday mood. Any communication that I do this time will be ignored as it should be. There are better things to do in life. So after I talk with Sam I'm going to slow down everything until new year.</li>
        <li class="people">And being the Christmas season, I can use this time to make amends with people. I say "people" because, well it isn't one or two fellas that I have to make amends to. It's a whole list. I've been a bad boy, but Santa's still packing gifts so if I can be quick about it I might get lucky!</li>
	<li class="lesson">And since I'm being honest about everything today, let me also admit that I've been reading all this Philosophy because I've been running away from the real deal. Trying to rationalize everything with nonsense. Hiding behind ideals is also cowardly. Sorry Seneca, but its true.</li>
        <li class="milestone">By the way I've been blogging for 4 years now. So that's one good thing. Never thought I'd be able to stick to it. But I did. Good for me.</li>
        <li>If I were running an accelerator all I would do is get founders' mothers unannounced in the office from time to time. That'll keep them on their toes and forever motivated.</li>

          <li class="people">Met with Pranav yesterday. Things are going as usual for him. They are moving back to Monte Carlo and will keep working from there. We talked about old stuff. It was good seeing him again, we made plans for a get tighter with the old team. A good time to be patching up on our differences. Much water has passed under the bridge.</li>
          <li class="people places">Omkar is fun! Met with him yesterday had breakfast. First the conversation took it's usual turn about plans for the future... I have come to accept that this is a part of small talk and we must get through the future before we can talk about the present. I told him my plans. He told me his. I shared my experience and he shared his. All went well. Then we suddenly decided to go a a mini trip to Ponda. Changed our mind midway and went to Bigfoot museum instead.  I was able to make it back for a call with Miguel in the Evening. Good times :) His mom is coming on Friday so I probably won't be seeing him any time soon.</li>
          <li> Just when I thought that things were going to get slower, I've got a week full of meetings. I'm not complaining, just that I don't understand. Being the holiday season I'd expect people to you know relax and have fun and be in a little "I can't care about his right now" type of mood. But things are going as usual. Okay.</li>
          <li class="places"> Arambol is much better in the night. Went there a few days back and stayed around for the live music outside the bar.The band played covers for "Blue suede shoes" and "Road house blues" and many others that I could not recognize. It was a good performance.</li>
          <li>The talk with Sam got postponed. No worries though I'm prepared and we can do it any time we want.</li>
          <li>Overall things are still hard in the sense that I moving very slow and I'm not sure what will be the result of the effort that I'm putting in. But at least I've got something to do. That's good.</li>
          <li class="milestone">From May to December I've sent in excess of 1000 emails. And I'm not planning to slow down anytime soon.</li>
          <li>Eyes on the road, hands upon the wheel!</li>

          <li class="people">Shijin came back to Goa. He had contracted malaria so he went back home to recover. Thankfully it was very mild and he got better within a week. Anyway he's back now and has already started going to work. Its good to have him around.</li>
          <li>In the last few days I've been on call with many people to discuss an opportunity for some kind of collaboration. Of all the places I've had best response from Romania and Hungary. Neither of these are fintech popular countries but they could be good for me because they want to establish a fintech presence. Which means that they are more open to applicants. Where as in other places fintech startups are dime a dozen. So I have to really stand out to even get a chance for an interview. Any way,like I said, I'll work with whatever I get.</li>
          <li class="people">So the talk with Sam got postponed again. It's supposed to happen today and I hope this time we talk and not postpone it anymore.</li>
          <li class="lesson">Often I do think of quitting and searching for a job again. Its so much easier, you don't have to worry about anything else but your work. I don't understand why people whine so much. I guess one of the benefits about trying to run your own business is that you get to see the really hard stuff, so all the other difficulties become insignificant in comparison. Its like training in 99G.</li>
          <li>The problem with me is that I start to fee a bit suffocated in a job. It gets really numbing after a time doing the same kind of stuff over and over. I need a bit of variety in work. So if (or when) I look for a job again I'm going to make sure that I have some room for creativity. Either in the work (which I think would be very unlikely), or in the form of time availability for other pursuits.</li>
          <li class="lesson">Again and again I've regretted putting all my eggs in a basket. But I don't seem to learn anything from the failures. This is just pig headedness. I must not decline work when its made available. I must always have a couple of good solid projects in the bag that I can fall back upon when it gets tough (and it invariably does).</li>
          <li>Overall life is good, only that I don't know where its headed. Which is exciting when everything is going well, but not so exciting when it's not!</li>
	  <li>The festivals are approaching and I can sense positivity in the air. The streets are decorated. At night there are lights all around. Everything feels vibrant.</li>

          <li class="people">Talked with Sankaran today. He's also working on his startup full time. Things are much difficult for him than they are for me. Being a father to a baby girl I can only imagine the belief it would take to give up everything and work on a startup. He's an inspiration. Although I'm disappointed that he can't work with me (I really wanted him) I do want him to be successful. He deserves it. The good thing is we can exchange notes and give each other advice on how to proceed. Even though we are not working together it feels as if we're in the same boat.</li>
          <li class="people"> I also gave a call to Mohit today and it seems that he won't be able to work with me as well. He's found an opportunity in Netherlands and he'll be pursuing that. Don't blame him. I would have done the same thing myself. But like Sankaran he's an exceptional programming talent and would have been an asset if he had agreed to join. But he did say that he didn't know how things turn out in the future. So I guess maybe some other time under different circumstances he might join me. That would be good.</li>
          <li class="places">Yesterday I went to Serendipity Arts Festival. I learnt that the real Abbe Faria was a Goan. I only knew "Abbe" as the guide/teacher to Edmond Dantes in the novel "The count of Monte Cristo" who not only got a dejected Edmond on his feet again but also told him about the hidden treasure that would make him powerful and rich beyond measure.I was quite thrilled to discover the Goan connection with the Count of Monte Cristo. I guess I was here for a reason!</li>
	  <li>I got introductions to a couple of Swiss fintech accelerators. The contact in embassy was very helpful. Not only did she got in me in touch with her contacts in India she also reached out to her personal connections in Switzerland. Whether I get something out of these introductions or not, I'm very thankful to her for helping me out. These unexpected favours are a confidence booster that helps me keep going.</li>
          <li> I'm also thinking about moving back to ggn. There's nothing much left to do here in Goa and it would probably be better if I stayed at home. Plus there's a meeting with Sam in Delhi on 16 Jan so I don't want to keep shuffling between two places. It gets tiresome.</li>
          <li>My chess puzzle rating is falling. I'm definitely getting duller!!</li>
          <li>MD is coming next week. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm sure everything will turn out to be good.</li>
	  <li>It's the season of Christmas. Charity, mankind, mercy, benevolence and forbearance are my business.</li>
