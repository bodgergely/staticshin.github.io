      <h1>Activity Log</h1>
      <p>13, Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Woke up late, bathed early.</li>
	<li>Went to get the mobile repaired,the shop was closed.
	  Will have to go there again tomorrow,I guess</li>        
        <li>Spent the day doing chores (cooked!, edited old posts) and answering emails.</li>
        <li class="reading">Tried reading but was too distracted.Watched Dr House instead.</li>
        <li class="milestone">Finally started the activity log so the day was not entirely useless :) </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
          <li>Had a great breakfast (<em>kale chane and halwa!</em>). Anirudh cooks really well. </li>
          <li class="writing">Collected articles and reference materials for a post on Mutual Authentication Systems (MAS)</li>
          <li>Went to the mobile repair shop despite the rains. Was relieved when the guy in charge accepted the warranty on the phone without making much fuss about the broken SIM slot. Hopefully the manufacturer will comply as well.</li>
          <li>Anirudh got an SMS for jio sim activation. Couldn't figure out how to actually "activate" it .Wasted the entire afternoon running after the reliance representative, who in turn suggested that we call the customer care instead. The customer care could not be reached .</li>
          <li>Went for a walk in the evening. It rained. I got wet.</li>
          <li class="reading">Had dinner at Manipal. Answered some emails. Ended the day after reading Chesterton and Aristotle. </li>
          <li>Have decided that I'd finish everything by 11 PM and write the log before going to sleep.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>15 Sep 2016</p>
      <ul>
          <li class="reading">Started reading about corporate/investment banking in the morning. Had a headache by 11. Went out to get some bananas.They were heavenly.</li>
          <li>It rained all afternoon. Stopped for a little while in the evening. I managed to go for a walk without getting wet. </li>
          <li>Talked with guys from wescott capital. They suggested that I update my linkedin profile. I really want to do that,but it's boring to write about work related stuff. Maybe someday.</li>
          <li>It rained in the night. Got wet on way to dinner. Good thing I took my jacket.</li>
          <li>Prepared a pitch for Prashanthi. She wanted "low hanging fruits" in corporate banking. The initial plan was low hanging enough. Was afraid that if I "lowered" it anymore the fruit might fall on the ground and rot. Therefore I added "low hanging" in the title and reworded the same pitch. I think it's good to go. Will find out tomorrow.</li>
          <li class="reading">Didn't read any good stuff. Will make up for the loss in the weekend.</li>
      </ul>
