	  Will have to go there again tomorrow,I guess</li>        
        <li>Spent the day doing chores (cooked!, edited old posts) and answering emails.</li>

        <li>Finally started the activity log so the day was not entirely useless :) </li>

          <li>Had a great breakfast.</li>
          <li>Collected articles and reference materials for a post on Mutual Authentication Systems (MAS)</li>
          <li>Went to the mobile repair shop despite the rains. Was relieved to know that the guy accepted the warranty on the phone. Hopefully the manufacturer will comply as well.</li>
          <li>Anirudh got an SMS for jio sim activation. Couldn't figure out how to actually "activate" it .Wasted the entire afternoon running after the reliance representative who in turn suggested that we call the customer care instead. The customer care could not be reached .</li>
          <li>Went for a walk in the evening. It rained. I got wet.</li>
          <li>Had dinner. Answered some emails. Ended the day after reading Chesterton and Aristotle. </li>
          <li>Have decided that I'd finish everything by 11 PM and write the log before going to sleep.</li>
