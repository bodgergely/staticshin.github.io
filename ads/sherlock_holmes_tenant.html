      "Hello Madam. I am Sherlock Holmes.
      You might have heard of me. I am looking for a place to stay with my friend
      Dr. Watson. I believe the room on the first floor is vacant?"

      "It's elementary Madam. I detected a slight shortness of
      breath and noticed a few beads of perspiration on your forehead,
      no doubt caused by exertion as you quickly came down a
      flight of stairs to answer my knock. And weren't you dusting Madam,
      as the marks on your black dress clearly show.
      Surely you wouldn't be dusting an occupied room? Now would you Madam?
      It's been vacant for now what 3 months is it?"
