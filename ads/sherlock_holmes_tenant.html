    "Hello Madam. I am Sherlock Holmes.
    You might have heard of me. I am looking for a place to stay with my friend
    Dr. Watson. I believe the room on the first floor is vacant?" 
 
  
</p>
<p>
  
  "What makes you say so?"
  
</p>

<p>
  
  
    "It's elementary Madam. I detected a slight shortness of
    breath and noticed a few beads of perspiration on your forehead,
    no doubt caused by exertion as you quickly came down a
    flight of stairs to answer my knock. And weren't you dusting Madam,
    as the marks on your black dress clearly show.
    Surely you wouldn't be dusting an occupied room? Now would you Madam?
    It's been vacant for now what 3 months is it?"
  
  
</p>
<p>
  
  "Dusting while wearing my bonnet? You have been sightly off in your conclusion Mr Holmes.
    But how can you.."
  
</p>

<p>
  
  " It's quite evident from the un-received letters in the mailbox. The previous occupier did not even
    care to collect his belongings?"
  
  
</p>

<p>
  
  
    "He asked me to burn them.But tell me Mr Holmes did you miss the 'All rooms occupied' sign on the door?"
  
  
</p>

<p>
  
  " Ah! But I am sure you can make some adjustments? I need very little space just to rest my back a little
    when I am not shooting at doors or smoking pipe or poisoning stray animals.
