        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

	<p>The concept I have in mind is still very fresh and is based on rent cafe a product by yardi, one of the leading property management solution in the world.</p>

	<p>Here's what I'm thinking:- </p>

        <ul>
          <li> Create an app that allows landlords to set up a website on the internet after filling in just a couple of form fields:- Like the address of the property, rooms available and a few pictures of their property. These websites will be published under subdomains like (mthomson.wrinq.com) but can be mapped to a unique domain like lodgersite.com  (if the user is in possession of the domain name).Of course we'll provide an easy way to the user to buy and sell domain names with the help of godaddy api. 
	  </li>
          <li>Automatically create a facebook page for each website so created, that would help the landlords with their branding and increase their reach. Integrate twitter and other mailing channels to help in communication with their prospects.</li>
          <li>Allow the users coming on their website either via google/by facebook pages to book rooms. The landlord will get a notification every time someone books. He can either deny/accept the request.  Further the landlord would have an analytics page where they can see the countries from where most visits/bookings are happening and hence they can make adjustments to suit the tastes of their clients.  
	  </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The big idea</strong></p>


	<p>Over the years airbnb has created a huge markeplace for short term rentals but there are still hundreds of thousands of room providers who are without a website (which has become a basic requirement these days). Airbnb gives them an additional income but this income can't be sustained because hosts are not building a brand. A customer may stay in your house on one vacation and then just disappear. It's important that that your place gets recommendations and that is difficult to do when you are just one among the hundreds of room providers on a website. </p>

	<p>Even within the long term rental community there are often dry periods where the rentals properties remain unoccupied. It is possible to reduce the time of these dry spells.</p>

	<p>Why not increase the chances of being found out by having your own business website? Accept/ Deny bookings from that website and cater to a short term rental market when you feel like it and switch to long term rentals when better prospects are available? </p>

	<p>So my question is:-  If we were to build a solution that would help the landlords in their branding/exposure and give them flexibility to use their property any way they like, would it be something that could be well received?  </p>
