      <h1>What is couchdb?</h1>
      <p>
	couchdb is a document oriented database,
	written using a highly concurrent and fault tolerant programming language:erlang,
	that comes with an easy to use web api. 
	Data is stored as JSON.  An http api and a data format that is
	universally understood makes couchdb one of the most easy to use database there is.
      </p>
      <p>
	couchdb imposes no restrictions on your database schema. You can change your documents
	to adapt to your changing business requirements. And to top it off couchdb
	provides a server side javascript environment that you can use to implement unique ways to extract your data,
	transform your documents, validate their properties, execute unit tests with real data 
	and even do things like rendering a template.
	Truth is once you really start to get a hang of couchdb you will notice that 
	the boundaries between a database and an application server start to blur.
	You start doing things that you never thought would even be possible with a database.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What can I do with it?</strong></p>
      <p>
	Since data is stored as documents in couchdb any problem that can be
	represented in terms of documents would be a good fit for couchdb.
	Thus real world businesses that involve a lot of documents would
	find themselves right at home in couchdb. You can develop solutions for:-

        <ul>
          <li>Legal industry</li>
          <li>Real estate industry</li>
          <li>Education industry</li>
          <li>Medical industry</li>
          <li>Publishing industry</li>
          <li>Banking  industry</li>
        </ul>
	But these are just the obvious use cases. Once you start to understand the powerful
	incremental map/reduce you will see that
	it can be used to build anything from recommendation engines to content management systems.  	
      </p>
      <p><strong>Who is using couchdb?</strong></p>
      <p>
	Lots of people.
	The folks at <a href="http://www.dimagi.com/" target="_blank">dimagi</a>
	are using it to build health care
	and logistics systems for developing countries.
	<a href="http://npmjs.org/" target="_blank">npm</a>,
	the famed node js package manger uses couchdb to serve a ridiculous <strong>356,273,496 packages per month</strong>
      </p>

      <h1>Do I really need someone to train my team?</h1>
      <p>
	Nope. couchdb has one of the best documentation that I have seen in an opensource project.
	And all of it's available directly from within couchdb. If you take the time
	you can do it on your own no problem. Sometimes however the time is in short supply.
	Or maybe you are having a difficult time grasping some of the
	concepts of couchdb (" wait no dynamic queries!!!"). I can help if that is the case.
	At the end of the session your team will feel confident about developing applications with couchdb.
      </p>
