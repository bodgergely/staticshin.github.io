      <h1>What is couchdb?</h1>
      <p>
	couchdb is a document oriented database,
	written using a highly concurrent and fault tolerant programming language,erlang,
	that comes with an easy to use web api. All data within couchdb is stored as JSON.
	This combination of an http api and a data format that is universally understood
	makes couchdb one of the most easy to use database there is.
      </p>
      <p>
	couchdb imposes no restrictions on your schema. You can easily adapt your documents
	to your changing business requirements. And to top it off couchdb
	allows you to execute server side javasript code which can be used to implement unique ways of
	extracting your data, transforming your documents, validating their properties,
	rendering templates and much more. Truth is once you start to get a hang of couchdb you will notice that 
	the boundaries between a database and an application server start to blur.
	You start doing things that you never thought were even possible with a database.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Okay so what can I do with it?</strong></p>
      <p>
	Since data is stored as documents any problem that can be
	represented in terms of documents would be a good fit.
	This means that real world businesses or business transactions
	that involve a lot of documents would
	find themselves right at home with couchdb. You can develop solutions for:- 
        <ul>
          <li>Legal industry</li>
          <li>Real estate industry</li>
          <li>Education industry</li>
          <li>Medical industry</li>
          <li>Publishing industry</li>
          <li>Banking  industry</li>
        </ul>
	
	But these are just the obvious use cases. Once you understand the powerful
	incremental map/reduce you will see that it can be used to build anything
	from recommendation engines to content management systems.  	
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>So who is using couchdb?</strong></p>
      <p>
	Lots of people.
	The folks at <a href="http://www.dimagi.com/" target="_blank">dimagi</a>, for instance,
	are using it to build health care
	and logistics systems for developing countries.
	<a href="http://npmjs.org/" target="_blank">npm</a>,
	the famed node js package manger uses couchdb to serve a ridiculous
	<strong>356,273,496 packages per month</strong>.
      </p>
      <h1>Do I really need someone to train my team?</h1>
      <p>
	Nope. couchdb has great documentation, one of the best I have seen in an opensource project.
	And all of it's available directly from within couchdb. If you take the time
	you can do it on your own, no problem. Sometimes however time is in short supply.
	Or maybe you are having difficulties in grasping some of the
	concepts of couchdb (" wait no dynamic queries!!!"). I can help if that is the case.
      </p>
      <h1>The course (7 days)</h1>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
	  We start with the concept of documents.
	  See how they are stored in couchdb. Answer some questions like "What the heck is a _rev?" 
	  And We learn how documents are organized into databases.
	</li>
        <li>Then we learn how to do CRUD on couchdb.</li>
        <li>
	  Then we talk about design documents. We learn how to manage them. We learn about
	  commonjs modules and about update,show and validate functions.</li>
        <li>Then we talk about views(map/reduce). The query server. And the list functions.</li>
        <li>
	  Then we talk about authentication and authorization both across the entire server and an isolated database.
	</li>
        <li>Then we talk about couchdb configuration files and replication.</li>
        <li>Finally we finish off the course with a discussion on some clever stuff that you can do with couchdb.</li>
      </ul>
