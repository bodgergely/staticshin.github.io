      <div class="postBody"><p>When I first started work on brislink the only itch that I wanted to scratch was to create something.At that time it did not matter what I made so long I made something.It so happened that I was learning a <a href="http://www.nodejs.org" target="_blank">new technology</a> so I was really pumped up to work with it.</p>

<p>In its first iteration brislink was a url sharing application.All it did was to  allow the users to share links to stories on the internet that they found interesting.I was really proud of my work but I soon found out that it was not really useful to me.In the first week of launch I was very aggressive in submitting links but I soon lost interest and just left it as it was.It was much later that I decided to make it into what it is today.</p>

<p>I blog frequently.Most of the time on my <a href="http://www.staticshin.com" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.After writing a couple of posts I used to submit the links on <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/" target="_blank">gamefaqs</a> hoping that someone would read it and give me some valuable feedback.I did get a few encouraging nods but most of the time my writing faded into <a href="http://blog.brislink.com/2013/03/26/obscurity/" target="_blank">obscurity</a>.It was during one day when I was submitting my article that I thought to myself</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What if instead of submitting my articles manually to others I could broadcast it automatically where any one could see it?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this simple initial idea ,which was born out of my problem of having to submit my posts to others for them to read, I  <a href="http://blog.brislink.com/2013/03/19/re-introduction/" target="_blank">reimagined brislink</a>.Soon I started blogging both on my own blog and on brislink.This gave rise to another problem that I was sure would be shared by many of you as well.</p>

<p>Often we tend to blog on mutiple websites.It was true for me and some other folks that I knew.It would be nice if someone could track these posts of the user across these multiple websites and collate them in one place.I decided to implement it.After a few days of hacking I managed to make it work.Here is my <a href="http://www.brislink.com/profile/551f38f88e55e30667d81ad5f64f4dd9/akshat-jiwan-sharma" target="_blank">profile</a> it contains all the contrbutions that I have made to various websites.It is really statisfying to see all your work nicely arranged right before your eyes.</p>

<p>At the time of my wirting not many people use brislink.To be completely honest I am the only one who is using it.But it makes me really happy.I had a few problems that I managed to solve and if it helps someone else in the process or makes them happy it is all bonus to me.</p>

<p><strong>brislink has reincarnated as <a href="http://brislink.github.io/specter/">specter</a>, the posts in the brislink blog have moved to my <a href="http://www.staticshin.com/">personal blog</a></strong></p>
