        <p>
	  Okay so a lady falls in love with a fisherman. Father prohibits marriage.
	  Lady takes her life. That's Dona Paula's story in two[1] sentences for you.
	  It's a classic tragedy. One that causes a kind soul to wonder if there's any
	  fairness in the world. In these moments one tends to become a little brooding and
	  melancholy. If life were a movie then it wouldn't be an inappropriate time to
	  play one of <a target="_balnk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyLl0QjDvg0">
	    Mozart's mournful tunes</a> in the background.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Experience teaches one that in such moments of sadness it is important
	  to have a "glass half full" outlook about you. It is undeniably true that
	  a great injustice had been done. But life goes on. 
	  After a refreshing sip from a cool coconut one feels ready to make a move.
	  A gentle swipe on the touchscreen brings up a wikitravel
	  guide. The following sentence dances on the tablet:</p>
        <blockquote>"The myth says Dona Paula is entombed
	  in the Cabo Chapel of Raj Bhawan and
	  is supposed to be seen
	  emerging from the moonlit waves
	  <strong>wearing only a pearl necklace</strong>".
	</blockquote>
        <p>
	  After reading this sentence I became conscious of a strange commotion in my head.
	  The monkeys on the upper floor had started paddling hard. A bulb lit up.
	  I said to myself -- "Akshat,old friend, when a lady gives you an opportunity to see
	  her pearls you don't sit around and muse on life. These things are best reserved for a
	  rainy day, which are plentiful by the way. This is the time to stand up and take action.
	  The monkeys might be on to something here. Who knows when one might
	  get lucky? Not one moment to loose" 
	</p>
        <p>
	  And so it was decided. Dona Paula had my full attention.
	  She deserved a through exploration.
	  I started with The jetty. 
	</p>

        <p>
	  The jetty or the Dona Paula beach is a popular tourist attraction. The location
	  provides an excellent view of sunrise and sunset. On one side there is the Marmagao bay
	  ,the meeting place of Zurari and Mandovi rivers.
	  And on the other side there is the Arabian Sea stretching into infinity. 
	</p>
     
        <p>
	  On the edge of the beach one can find the
	  statue of Dona Paula and Gasper Dias (presumably) standing beside each other.
	  The tender vibes of the place
	  attract a lot of love birds from far and wide. An innocent passer by would do well
	  whistle or clap loudly as he traverses this territory to broadcast his presence to
	  the poultry too busy pecking at each other. It would be nice if these fowls took
	  their business to some other secluded place and save themselves and other tourists some
	  embarrassment. One must learn to deal with such troubles
	  if one wants to enjoy the scenery, which to be honest is quite breathtaking. 
	</p>
        <p>Along the beach you can find shops selling everything from hats to soda and other stronger drinks.
	  Beverages are nice, hats are good as well as long as one remembers that the
	  jetty is not a good place to wear them. 
	  Being  windy and all it is far better to let the air flow through your hair than constantly
	  struggle to keep the <em>topee</em> fixed on the top of your head. If you'd like to take a photo or two
	  of yourself wearing a fancy headgear the pose in which you can hold the rim would be the most
	  practical one if you ask me. A smile would definitely add to the overall effect.
	  Saying cheese would work too. 
	</p>
        <p>By the night, as the tide rises, the jetty is lined with fishermen
	  trying their luck in the waters. Some here for sport, some for evening's meal.
	  On the whole the mood becomes quite lively as the people get competitive
	  with the passage of time. 
	</p>
        <p>The term jetty refers to the wide variety of water sports that are available
	  for the thrill seeker. A person with such an inclination may indulge in paragliding,
	  water scooter rides, kayaking and what not.  
	</p>
        <p>After hearing about the prices of these excursions, however, I thought it more prudent to
	  take flight in my imagination -- so to speak.
	  It's cheaper, lasts longer and the general 
	  atmosphere of the place is conducive to day dreaming.
	</p>

        <p>The Hawaii beach (sounds a bit familiar but I can't seem to remember where I've heard about it before)
	  is a quiet place on the other side of the jetty. What makes it interesting however is
	  the small portion of land hidden away, beyond the rocks on the edge. The land runs along in a curve for
	  no more than 20 feet. But the sand is golden,
	  embedded with broken shells and the water is the lightest of blues.
	  There is no one to disturb you here and if like you can have a little heart to heart with
	  mother nature. Oh and every wave brings along a fistful of distinctive shells with it.
	  Now I know what Count of Monte cristo must have felt like when he found that treasure island.
	  Definitely my favorite place to be. 
	</p>
        <p>As for Dona. I think she is playing hard to get. Everybody else seems to have seen her pearls
	  but she wouldn't let me have a glimpse. Oh well plenty of fish![2]
	</p>

	<p> Just beside the jetty there is the Oceanography institute. 
	  In the mornings one can see students walking hurriedly along to attend their classes. A few museums in
	  the institute, I've been told, are open to the visitors. If one walks a bit further from the
	  institute one can find an abandoned English cemetery that was built some 200 years ago. The gates are locked,
	  though the graves are visible from the outside. It looks peaceful  with green grass, a couple of trees and a well.
	  A good place to go to on Halloween night.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Me and the dogs of Dona Paula, we don't get along well.
	  I don't why that is because when my biographer
	  makes inquiries on the matter he is sure to find that
	  I was very good with dogs in general. Most of them liked me.
	  He would ultimately reach the conclusion that I was mostly a dog person.
	  These dogs were, however, peculiar. Always in a foul mood. Eager to taste blood.
	  Unaware of whom they were up against. Some dogs learn the lessons the hard way.
	  It's unfortunate and something that could have been avoided.
	  But what should  a canine do when he refuses to
	  listen to the voice of reason? Learn to swim I suppose?
