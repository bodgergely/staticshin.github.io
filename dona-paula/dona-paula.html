        <p>
	  Okay so lady falls in love with a fiserman. Father prohibits marriage.
	  Lady takes her life. That's Dona paula's story in two[1] sentences for you.
	  It's a classic tragedy. One that causes a kind soul to wonder if there's any
	  fairness in the world. In these moments one tends to become a little brooding and
	  melancholy. If life was a movie then it wouldn't be an inappropriate time to
	  play mozarts Violin Sonata K.378 in the background.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Experinece teaches one that in such moments of sadness it is important
	  to have a "glass half full" perspective about you. It is undeniably true that
	  a great injustice had been done. But life goes on. 
	</p>
        <p>A refreshing sip from a cool coconut
	  followed by gentle swipe on the touchscreen brings up a wikitravel
	  guide. The following sentence stood out:</p>
        <p>
	  "A myth says Dona Paula entombed in the Cabo Chapel is sipposed to be seen
	  emerging from the moonlit waves <strong>wearing only a pearl necklace</strong>
	  "
	</p>
        <p>
	  The monkeys on the upper floor started paddling hard. A bulb lighted up.
	  I said to myself -- "Akshat,old firend, when a lady gives you an opportunity to see
	  her pearls you don't sit around and muse on life. These things are best reserved for a
	  rainy day, which are plentiful by the way. This is the time to stand up and take action.
	  The monkeys might be on to something here. Who knows when one might
	  get lucky?"
	</p>
        <p>
	  And so it was decided.
	  Dona Paula deserved a through exploration.
	  It had my full attention.
	  I started with The jetty. 
	</p>
        <p><strong>The Jetty</strong></p>
        <p>The jetty or the Dona Paula beach is a very popular tourist attraction. </p>
	<p><strong>Abandoned English Cemetary</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Oceanography institute</strong></p>
        <p>Something for the hardned explorer. For science. </p>
        <p>As for Dona. I think she is playing hard to get. Everybody else seems to have seen her pearls
	  but she wouldn't let me have a glimpse. Oh well plenty of fish![2]
	</p>
        <p><strong>---Wanted---</strong></p>
        <p>A co-conspirator.
	  A partner in crime.
	  A pirate with an unquencahbe thirst for adventure.
	  A captain haddock to explore the miles of uninterruped sea,
	  kilometers of strange land and to fathom the depths of
	  fresh waters. Dangers? Many.Safety? Not guaranteed.</p>
