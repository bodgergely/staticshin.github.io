        <p>
	  Okay so a lady falls in love with a fiserman. Father prohibits marriage.
	  Lady takes her life. That's Dona paula's story in two[1] sentences for you.
	  It's a classic tragedy. One that causes a kind soul to wonder if there's any
	  fairness in the world. In these moments one tends to become a little brooding and
	  melancholy. If life were a movie then it wouldn't be an inappropriate time to
	  play one of <a target="_balnk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyLl0QjDvg0">
	    Mozart's mournful tunes</a>
	  in the background.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Experinece teaches one that in such moments of sadness it is important
	  to have a "glass half full" outlook about you. It is undeniably true that
	  a great injustice had been done. But life goes on. 
	  After a refreshing sip from a cool coconut one feels ready to make a move.
	  A gentle swipe on the touchscreen brings up a wikitravel
	  guide. The following sentence dances on the tablet:</p>
        <blockquote>"The myth says Dona Paula is entombed
	  in the Cabo Chapel of Raj Bhawan and
	  is supposed to be seen
	  emerging from the moonlit waves
	  <strong>wearing only a pearl necklace</strong>".
	</blockquote>
        <p>
	  Afte reading this sentence I became conscious of a strange commotion in my head.
	  The monkeys on the upper floor started paddling hard. A bulb lighted up.
	  I said to myself -- "Akshat,old firend, when a lady gives you an opportunity to see
	  her pearls you don't sit around and muse on life. These things are best reserved for a
	  rainy day, which are plentiful by the way. This is the time to stand up and take action.
	  The monkeys might be on to something here. Who knows when one might
	  get lucky? Not one moment to loose" 
	</p>
        <p>
	  And so it was decided. Dona Paula had my full attention.
	  She deserved a through exploration.
	  I started with The jetty. 
	</p>
        <p><strong>The Jetty</strong></p>
        <p>
	  The jetty or the Dona Paula beach is a popular tourist attraction. The location
	  provides an excellent view of sunrise and sunset. One can see a vast strech of ocean
	  in front. On one side there is the Marmagao bay--the meeting place of Zurari and Mandovi
	  rivers. And on the other side there is the Arabian Sea streching into inifinity. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  On the edge of the beach one can find the
	  statue of Dona Paula and Gasper Dias embarcing each other.
	  The sentimental feelings of the place
	  attract a lot of love birds from far and wide. An innocent passer by would do well
	  whistle or clap loudly as he traverses this territory to broadcast his presence to
	  the poultry too busy pecking at each other. It would be nice if these fowls took
	  their business to some other secluded place and save themselves and other tourists some
	  embarrasement (behold the murdourous eyes in case accidently stumble upon a pair).
	  One must learn to deal with such troubles
	  if one wants to enjoy the scenery, which to be honest is breathtaking. 
	</p>
        <p>Along the beach you can find shops selling everything from hats to soda. Beverages are nice
	  , hats are good as well as long as one remembers that the jetty is not a good place to wear them.
	  Being uite windy and all it is far better to let the wind flow to your hair than constantly
	  struggle to keep the hat on top of your head. If you'd like to take a photo or two
	  of youself wearing a headgear the pose in which you can hold the rim would be the most
	  practical one if you ask me. 
	</p>
        <p>By the night as the waters of the sea rise the jetty is lined with fishermen trying their luck in </p>
        <p>The term jetty refers to the wide variety of water sports that are available
	  for the thrill seeker. A person with such an inclination may indulge in paragliding,
	  water scooter rides, kayaking and what not.  
	</p>
        <p>After hearing about the prices of these activities,however, I thought it more prudent to
	  take flight in my imagination -- so to speak.
	  It's cheaper, lasts longer and the general 
	  atmosphere of the place is condusive to day dreaming.
	</p>
	
       	<p><strong>Abandoned English Cemetary</strong></p>
        <p>If one walks a bit further from the institue one can find an English cemetary that was built about
	  200 years ago. The place is locked though the graves are visible from the ouside. It looks peaceful
	  with green grass, a couple of trees and a well. A good place to go to on Halloween night. I made a note of it.
	  The gate is not to tall to climb over. Although going in would amount to tresspassing but
	  I'm more concerened about the dogs guarding the place. </p>
        <p>
	  Me and the dogs of Dona Paula, we don't get along well.
	  I don't why that is because when my bigrapher
	  will make inquiries on the matter he is sure to find that
	  I was very good with dogs in general. Most of them liked me.
	  He would ultimately reach the conclusion that I was mostly a dog person.
	  These dogs were however peculiar. Always in a foul mood. Eager to taste blood.
	  Didn't know who they were up against. Some dogs learn the lessons the hard way.
	  It's unfortunate and something that can be avoided
	  but what is one to do when a canine refuses to
	  listen to the voice of reason? Learn to swim I suppose?

        <p>Something for the hardned explorer. For science. </p>
        <p>As for Dona. I think she is playing hard to get. Everybody else seems to have seen her pearls
	  but she wouldn't let me have a glimpse. Oh well plenty of fish![2]
