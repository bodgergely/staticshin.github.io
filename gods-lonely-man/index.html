        <h1 class="center">Travis Bickle</h1>
        <p>Travis Bickle has a grim view of the world and the people in it. Little is known about his past
	  except that he fought in the vietnam war. He lives alone.
	  Likes to watch TV and drive in the streets at night. He can't sleep so he entertains
	  himself by watching porn and ruminating about how degraded the life in the city is. 
	</p>
        <p>His days are all the same.
	  Each one like the last.
	  Going on and on with no change.
	  Troubled by his thoughts he decides to take up the job of a
	  taxi driver hoping that he'd get to put in long hours
	  that might keep him from wallowing in misery and self pity.
	  And since he is driving through the streets anyway
	  he might as well get paid for it.
	  He's ready to work anytime and anywhere. Even on Jewish holidays. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  As he soon discovers however that it was not a very good choice. Travis finds himself surrounded
	  by the scum of the city. The lowlifes and the degenerates,
	  the dopers and the junkies, the sick and the venal. And suddendly he finds that he is living his
	  morbid thoughts. Sometimes cleaning off the cum, sometimes blood. He took a job. He became the job.
	</p>
        <p>
	  During the opening of the movie, Travis Bickle is a helpless man.
	  Lacking a purpose in life he drifts off dark corners. He can recognize the depravity both
	  of the city and his own thoughts but he can do nothing to get out. He cirlces around the same
	  streets and spends time with the same people who he has come to hate so much. 
	</p>
        <p>A change comes when travis meets Betsy. A working girl. Throughly disciplined
	  and organized, unlike Travis. He manages to summon up the courage of going over and talking to
	  her </p>
        <p>
	  It seems however that Betsy didn't share travis' taste in movies (porn)
	  and she calls off the thing when he takes her to a shady theater.
	  Should travis have known better? Honestly I don't know. It seemed that Travis had a good sense
	  of right and wrong. Even though he himself was addicted to porn he had an idea that it wasn't
	  right. With Betsie he could have chosen any other movie at any other time and yet he goes in
	  that same place that he didn't even like. It's very hard to understand the reason for his action.
	  Was he trying to test Betsie? Could this have been a practical joke? Just to tease her up?
	</p>
	<p>
	  Maybe what was inteded for the viewer was that even though Travis had an inclination to
	  improve himself he was still very much in the same dark corner that we found
	  him in the begineing of the movie. It would take something much stronger that a temporary
	  fling to get him out. 
	</p>
        <p>The episode with betsie leaves travis even more distrought than he had been. </p>
