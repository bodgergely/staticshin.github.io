        <p><strong>ACT 1</strong></p>
        <p>Gorgias, a renowned practioner of rhetoric along with his disciple Polus is presnt in the house
	  of Callicles. Socrates along with his disciple  Chaerephon are intrigued by Gorgias and want to
	  get a better understanding of what he does and what the nature of his art (rhetoric) is?</p>
	<p>
	  To which Gorgias replies that rhetoric is an art and he would call himself a rhetorician. This
	  answers the questions only in part for the assembly still does not know what is rhetoric
	  concerned with. As an example the art of weawing is concerned with making of garments. 
	</p>
        <p>Gorgias now gives a bit more detail to his explaination. Rhetoric is an art that is
	  concerned with discourse.</p>
        <p>
	  But does rhetoric treat all kinds of discourse? For example medicine is an art that allows
	  men to speak with certainty about what a person is inflicted with and how he may get well?
	  Is rhetoric same as the art of medicine then? 
	</p>
        <p>Certanly not, replies Gorgias as he is made to impose yet another limitation on his art.
	  But a desisive definition of rhetoric is still elusive. The questioning follows. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  Just like rhetoric can not be
	  called an art that deals with discourse concerning the sick. It can also not be said
	  that rhetoric is an art that deals with the discourse of gymnastics. Or in general 
	  with the discourse of subjects which an art form is concerned with? 
	</p>
        <p>Then why call rhetoric an art of discourse and not all the other art forms which
	  like medicine and gymnastics as the art of discource? </p>
        <p>This question leaves Gorgias a bit puzzled and he replies that the difference lies in the
	  fact that rhetoric is practiced only by the medium of the words and all the other art forms
	  that are described by socrates involve some action of hands. But Socrates is not satisfied by the
	  answer and the questioning continues</p>
        <p>It follows then that the art of painting which requires no words to be spoken
	  and other arts which proceed in silence also do not come whithin the art of
	  rhetoric. But what about the art of arithmetic which is entirely expressed
	  through the medium of words and use language to express themselves would it
	  be called rhetoric?
	</p>
        <p>Gorgias replies in negative. The questioning continues.</p>
        <p>Socrates now wishes to know what is the quality of the words that rhetoric concerns
	  itself with? For example the art of arithmetic (which is practiced with words) concerns itself about the
	  quantities of odd and even numbers and their relationship to one another. Then with what words the
	  art of rhetoric is concerned with?
	</p>
        <p>
          <em>"To the greatest, Socrates, and the best of human things."</em>
	</p>
        <p>Gorgias' reply seems to be amiguous to socrates. The question that naturally follows is what is the
	  greatest and the best in human beings? Is it health,beauty and wealth as the old saying goes? Because
	  what Gorgias says can be applied to any art form. For example the physican may say that my art
	  concerns with the greatest and best of human things. Because health is the greatest good.
	  And so may the money maker. Because wealth is the greates good. And so may the trainer. Because
	  health is the greatest good. He asks Gorgias what good is the greates of man? To which he replies
	</p>
        <p>
          <em>That good, Socrates, which is truly the greatest, being that which gives to men freedom in their own persons, and to individuals the power of ruling over others in their several states.</em>
	</p>
        <p>Socrates asks once more what good is that? Gorgias replies</p>
        <p>"What is there greater than the word which persuades the judges in the courts, or the senators in the council, or the citizens in the assembly, or at any other political meeting?â€”if you have the power of uttering this word, you will have the physician your slave, and the trainer your slave, and the money-maker of whom you talk will be found to gather treasures, not for himself, but for you who are able to speak and to persuade the multitude."</p>
        <p>This reply leaves scorates satisfied. And he concludes that rehetoric is an art of persuasion.
	  Gorgias agrees that persuasion is the cheif aim of rhetoric. But it still remains undecied whether
	  the art of persuasion is good or not. The questioning continues.</p>
