        <p><strong>ACT 1</strong></p>
	
        <p>Gorgias, a renowned practitioner of rhetoric is present in the house
	  of Callicles, along with his disciple Polus. Among the party are 
	  Socrates and his friend  Chaerephon. 
	  They are intrigued by Gorgias and want to
	  get a better understanding of what he does and what the nature of his profession is.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Gorgias explains that rhetoric is an art and he would call himself a rhetorician. Socrates however
	  finds this answer unsatisfactory as he does not understand what rhetoric is concerned with.
	  For  example the art of weaving is concerned with the making of garments. What does the
	  person practicing the art of rhetoric do?
	</p>
        <p>Gorgias now gives a bit more detail to his explanation saying that rhetoric is an art that is
	  concerned with discourse.</p>
        <p>
	  But does rhetoric treat all kinds of discourse? For example medicine is an art that allows
	  men to speak with certainty about what a person is inflicted with and how he may get well.
	  Is rhetoric same as the art of medicine then? 
	</p>
        <p>Certainly not, replies Gorgias as he is made to impose a limitation on his profession.
	  But a decisive definition of the rhetoric is still elusive. The questioning continues. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  Just like rhetoric can not be
	  called an art that deals with discourse concerning the sick. It can also not be said
	  that rhetoric is an art that deals with the discourse of gymnastics or the discourse of geometry.
	  Or in general with the discourse of subjects which an art form is concerned with? 
	</p>
        <p>Then why just call rhetoric an art of discourse and not all the other art forms 
	  like medicine and gymnastics as the art of discourse as well? </p>
	
        <p>This question leaves Gorgias a bit puzzled and he replies that the difference lies in the
	  fact that rhetoric is practiced only by the medium of the words and all the other art forms
	  that are described by socrates involve some action of hands. But Socrates is not satisfied by the
	  answer and the questioning continues</p>
	
        <p>It follows then that the art of painting which requires no words to be spoken
	  and other arts which practiced in silence also do not come within the art of
	  rhetoric. But what about the art of arithmetic which is entirely expressed
	  through the medium of words and use language to express themselves? would it
	  be called rhetoric?
	</p>
	
        <p>Gorgias replies in negative. The questioning continues.</p>
	
        <p>Socrates now wishes to know what is the quality of the words that rhetoric concerns
	  itself with? For example the art of arithmetic concerns itself about the
	  quantities of odd and even numbers and their relationship to one another.
	  Then with what words is the art of rhetoric is concerned with?
	</p>
        <p>
          <em>"To the greatest, Socrates, and the best of human things."</em>
	</p>
	
        <p>Gorgias' reply seems to be ambiguous to Socrates. The question that naturally follows is what is the
	  greatest and the best in human beings? Is it health,beauty and wealth as the old saying goes? Because
	  what Gorgias says can be applied to any art form. For example the physician may say that my art
	  concerns with the greatest and best of human things. Because health is the greatest good.
	  And so may the money maker. Because wealth is the greatest good. And so may the trainer. Because
	  health is the greatest good. He asks Gorgias what good is the greatest of man? To which he replies
	</p>
        <p>
          <em>That good, Socrates,
	    which is truly the greatest, being that which gives to men freedom in their own persons,
	    and to individuals the power of ruling over others in their several states.
	  </em>
	</p>
        <p>Socrates asks once more what good is that? Gorgias replies</p>
	
        <p>
	  <em>
	    "What is there greater than the word which persuades the judges in the courts,
	    or the senators in the council, or the citizens in the assembly,
	    or at any other political meeting?â€”if you have the power of uttering this word,
	    you will have the physician your slave, and the trainer your slave,
	    and the money-maker of whom you talk will be found to gather treasures,
	    not for himself, but for you who are able to speak and to persuade the multitude."
	    
	  </em>
	</p>
	
        <p>This reply leaves scorates satisfied. And he concludes that rhetoric is an art of persuasion.
	  Gorgias agrees that persuasion is the chief aim of rhetoric. But is rhetoric the only art that
	  persuades. </p>
        <p>
          Sorcartes asserts that anyone who teaches anything persuades men of what he teaches.
	  For example arithmetic and arithmetician teaches us the properties of number. And persuade us of those
	  properties. Then does not arithmetic persuades just like rhetoric does? Which implies that rhetoric
	  is not the only art of persuasion. And therefore it is important that it is described what rhetoric persuades
	  men of?
	</p>
        <p>Gorgias replies:</p>
        <p>
	  <em>
	    "I answer, Socrates, that rhetoric is the art of
	    persuasion in courts of law and other assemblies,
	    as I was just now saying, and about the just and unjust."
	  </em>
	</p>
        <p>Socrates is not satisfied by the answer and reasons that there is such a thing as
	  having learned and having believed. And having believed is quite different from having learnt.
	  And there is also such a thing as false knowledge as well as false belief. And the two are also different
	  from each other. Both people who have learnt and people who believe can be persuaded just the same.</p>
	<p><em>"And which sort of persuasion does rhetoric create in courts of
	    law and other assemblies about the just and unjust,
	    the sort of persuasion which gives belief without knowledge, or that which gives knowledge?"
	  </em>
	</p>
        <p>Gorgias answers that rhetoric is the art that only creates belief.</p>
        <p>Socrates asks what good will rhetoric do for a person? For a rhetorician will not be consulted
	  with while building walls or making medicine.</p>
        <p>Gorgias answeres that the power of rhetoric lies in sway it holds over people</p>
        <p>
	  Socrates argues that if rhetoric is an art that persuades of belief without knowledge then rhetoric
	  only has an influence over the ignorant. For the rhetoric can not influence a physian about medicine
	  without knowldge of medicine, but only those who are ignorant about it. And that the rhetorician
	  does not have to know the truth about things but only discover a way to persuade people who are ignorant
	  of the the subject matter. 
	</p>
        <p>Gorgias finds great confort in the fact that it is powereful <em>not to have learnt any other
	  arts but the art of rhetoric only and yet in no way be inferior to persuaders of them.</em></p>
        <p>But then if the rhetorician is ignorant of other arts like medicine and arithmetic
	  but still hods the power to influence then would it not be reasonable to say that the rhetorician is
	  equally ignorant of the just and the unjust? </p>
        <p>A just man would never do an injustice. But a rehetorician might make a bad use
	  of rhetoric because he is ignorant about the notions of just and unjust. Socrates concludes
	  that the argument that a rhetorican praticies justice is proven to be false. </p>
