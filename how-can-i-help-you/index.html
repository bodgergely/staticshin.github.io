        <h1>What I do?</h1>
	<p>Hello I am Akshat :) I am an Independent consultant working in gurgaon,India. I help small-medium size business with their business problems. For example:-
	<p>I helped a medium sized law firm, 17 members at that time, by providing them with a better solution (as compared to excel) to keep detailed records of the cases they undertook. These records included:-

	  <ul>
            <li>If they were defending/prosecuting for a criminal charge: the charges levied against the defendant,the documents related to their defence (arguments,evidence and records of witnesses)</li>
            <li>If they were defending/pleading in a civil suit: sections of the act against which the releif was sought by the plaintiff,their response (including the arguments,evidence and records of witnesses)</li>
            <li>A log of dates starting from the commencement of the case right untill the end of it (including the dates where hearing, presentation of evidence etc were postponed)</li>
            <li> For each day on the dashboard a  list of cases to attend by a lawyer was shown</li>
            <li> At the end of each month a status report was mailed to the manager which included a summary timeline of the cases the costs incurred and the fees collected. </li>
	  </ul>
	  Technologies that I used: couchdb,nginx and jquery

        <h1>Technologies that I work with</h1>
        <p>I like to use the best tool for the job. However to give you an idea I have used couchdb,nodejs, nginx(and openresty) and elastic search in my professional capcity. For my own projects I have also worked with erlang (I also use it a lot with couchdb to create custom modules for things that aren't supported natively)
	</p>
        <p>On client side I use plain javscript/jquery and simple grid. There was a time when I used to use knockoutjs as a client side framework but I didn't get much value out of it. So now I keep things simple and use either plain old javascript or jquery if I need support for older browsers.</p>
	<p>I talk a lot more on programming and problems I solve <a href="http://www.staticshin.com/programming" target="_blank">on my blog</a>.
