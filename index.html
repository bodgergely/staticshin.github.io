        <p>I suppose that lately you've been watching re-runs of Sherlock and your fascination for our enigmatic detective is at an all time high. Not only would you like to have him in your house you would gladly assume the role of Mrs. Hudson and gratify Holmes with a cup of tea every morning while he sets your first floor on fire.</p>
	<p>I can almost picture you sitting wistfully in front of you computer screen thinking that anything would be better than your current &quot;boring&quot; tenants. You are perhaps asking yourself what could be <a href="/without-a-clue">so bad about this Holmes</a>? After all he has been worshipped by a generation of followers and has helped to solve some of the worlds most puzzling mysteries. Well dear reader let me tell you right now that Mr. Holmes is every landlord&apos;s/lady&apos;s nightmare. </p>

        <p>After spending 5 years in prison, for a crime he did not commit, Billy Brown finds himself out of place in the real world. So intimidating is this new found Independence to him that he asks the prison guards to let him in again so that he may use the prison facilities to relieve himself. On being denied entry he reluctantly boards the bus and goes to the city where his first contact with people is stiff, confused and erratic. Buffalo '66 introduces Billy to us when he's at his all time low. Prison has weakened him, he appears to be helpless and forsaken, someone who can't even find a place to piss. </p>

        <p><em>"The world will never starve for want of wonders; but only for want of wonder."</em></p>
        
	<p>The essay "Tremendous trifles" questions the need of doing extraordinary things in the name of adventure. It challenges the theory advocating the importance of travelling to unknown continents and climbing highest of mountains to gain vigour and zest in life. Instead it puts forth a remarkable idea that even the commonplace existence can be striking if only one chooses to observe the unremarkable and what appears to be ordinary with fascination.</p>

	<p>The Chapora fort was built by the Portugese on the top of a small hill as a watch post commanding an unobstructed view in all the four directions. A legend goes that in 1684, Sambhaji, the mighty Martha ruler, along with his troops climbed chapora with the help of monitor lizards causing the Portugese to surrender without a fight. Conflicts soon arose and the fort fell back in the hands of Portugese. It continued to change hands until the year 1892 when it became redundant and was finally abandoned.</p>

        <p>Recently I came upon this paper ,by Stacy Thompson, called 
	  <a href="http://www.film-philosophy.com/2009v13n1/thompson.pdf">Consumer ethics in thank you for smoking</a>. 
	  The subject matter of this piece is  Nick Naylor, the protagonist in
	  <a href="/thank-you-for-smoking">Thank you for smoking </a> and the goal is to find out whether 
	  Nick acted ethically or not in the movie. To determine that, Nick's actions are judged against moral guidelines laid down by great philosophers such as Aristotle and Kierkegaard. The paper itself is very well written and if you haven't already you should read it. But there were a few things I found a bit off and so I decided to an
	  analysis myself, taking Stacy's work as the base. </p>

        <p>
	  Be honest. What is it that you expect from a romantic book?
	</p>
        <p>Is it tragedy? Like Romeo and Juliet?
	  Or do you prefer a tale of heartbreak like Scarlet O'Hara's in 
	  <em>Gone with the wind</em>?
	  Perhaps you crave for a clashing of two strong willed, fiercely independent souls like
	  <em>Jane Eyre</em> and <em>Edward Fairfax Rochester</em>?</p>
        <p>
	  Is Romance for you drama, tension and desperate optimism 
	  of tragic heroes and heroines? Do you like the feeling of drowning melancholy when it is
	  clear that the time has come to say good by and good luck?
	  Would you rate a book depending upon the number of pages that were soiled by your overflowing tears?

	  Harry Callahan is a man of few words. He is not the type of person who expresses his emotions easily. I think it helps him do his job well. When you are chasing criminals day in and day out it's important that you have a certain hardened look about you. But when he is not performing his duty Harry is a very understanding and caring sort of a fellow. Most people never get to see that side of Harry's personality. Which is a tragedy if you ask me. As the self appointed PR manager for Harry I feel that it is my duty to show to you his sensitive side. <a href="/pensive/dirty_harry.html">

        <p>
	  Socrates and company assemble together in Callicles' house to have a deep philosophical
	  dialogue on rhetoric, justice , life and death. Naturally when the subject matter of the discussion
	  is so heavy there is no time for tea,cookies and other pleasantries. Questions are asked,
	  words are spoken and pride is hurt.</p>
	<p>
	  If you've ever wondered what philosophers do
	  when they go socializing, Gorgias might just satisfy your curiosity. Don't be surprised though
	  if you hear them shouting "I WONT TALK TO YOU EVER AGAIN". They are not that different from us :)

        <p> Travis Bickle is a helpless man.
	  Lacking a purpose in life he drifts off dark corners. He can recognize the depravity both
	  of the city and his own thoughts but he can do nothing to get out. He circles around the same
	  streets and finds  himself around the same people whom he has come to hate so much.

	<div><blockquote><p>"Enchante, madame! Merci beaucoup for not paying zee money, madame! Pardonnez-moi if I 'ave disturbed you,madame! How charmante you look in mourning,madame!"</p></blockquote><p>A frustrated bite from a proud banana. There are times in a chappie's life when he wonders if he has understood life as well as he thought. Why it was only a few days ago when one was negotiating life's volleys with a blissful carelessness, with a joyful spring in one's step and a radiant smile on one's face. It was all sunshine and roses. The birds were singing and the scent of flowers was in the air. One felt as happy as a dog rolling on the grass field on a sunny day. And now when one looks outside the window what does one find? Can one smell the flowers? "No". Does one hear the birds singing? "No". What about the sunshine that never fails to lift the spirit? "Everything seems to be covered in a curtain of mist".  One wonders what brought upon this change in one's attitude?</p></div>

	<div class="postMeta">-Thu Jul 23 2015</div>
	<div><blockquote><p>"Behold! human beings living in an underground den"</p></blockquote><p>About half way through "The republic" takes a dramatic turn. Up until this point Socrates had been talking about ideasin broad sweeps, doing little to tie things together. Book 7 focuses on the individual. The seeker of true knowledge and the tribulations he must go through to find it. Socrates also, through his words, shows his poetical skills. One would think that Socrates, after all his criticisms of poetry would not fall back to lyrical devices to explain his meaning but he does. Book 7 of "The republic" is in my (very humble) opinion the greatest allegory in literature. So draw the curtains. Dim the lights. Turn the music off. We are going into the cave.</p></div>

His remark  "You see but you do not observe" always rang a bit hollow with me. Sherlock hardly seemed to be a type of person who would have the patience to observe things. He was a sort of fellow who at one instant was quietly playing a mournful tune on his violin and at another jumping on to his chemistry set trying to decipher the composition of tobacco ash. It all seemed a bit fantastic. Which is why I was very excited at the idea of watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096454/">without a clue</a>, a documentary of sorts, exposing the truth behind Sherlock Holmes. Many layers of Holmes' personality were revealed to me that helped me understand the great "detective" better.   </p></div>
