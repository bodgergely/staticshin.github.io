Every time we meet our conversation turns to making plans of prospective journeys to interesting places. We love making plans so much that sometimes it seems it is all that we do. We can never have too many plans at once.  Why it was just the other day that we planned a week long vacation to Andaman islands. And in  the week before we decided that we wanted to go to that famous hill station in West Bengal, Darjeeling. It is not easy to come up with a location that suits both of us so it is hard work figuring out new places to go.  We feel satisfied after making these plans. It feels like a job well done.  </p></div>

        <div><p>I have been using asus x201e for six months now. It made  a very positive impression on me when I  <a href="/asus-x201e-review">reviewed</a> it last year. It was one of my most read posts so I decided to write more about my experience with the system. </p><p>One of the things that I really like about this unit is that it is so light. It is almost as light as a macbook air. Now most light laptops are heavy on the wallet. Not this one though. It costs about RS 20000 ($300 based on the current exchange rate) which makes it a very attractive proposition.  During these past months I have frequented many electronic shops and I could not find a single laptop as light as this. Except for macbook air all other higher priced units were considerably heavier. While most people I know don't make too much of an issue of the weight but for me it is essential that a laptop be as light as possible. As far as price to weight ratio is concerned asus x201e is unbeatable. </p></div>

        <div><p>I have been programming for a while now. I graduated in summer of 2011  and since then I have used a lot of different languages, frameworks, databases etc. I have a good understanding of  programming languages and I can pick up a new language/framework in a day or two. </p><p>I remember having started a lot of side projects just to play around with a new language or framework.  I scrapped almost all of them  before they could be finished. I don't regret killing them but I wish I had documented my experience of working on new exciting things just so I could look back from time to time and see how I got to where I am.  Unfortunately during that time, the thought never crossed my mind. I would have loved to read about what I was doing two years back. But dwelling over the past is futile. I have now made it a point to write about everything of importance to me right here on my blog. And in that spirit I am going to write about another little project of mine, <a href="http://www.wrinq.com/">wrinq</a>.</p></div>

Sure it was pretty but I could not understand what was going on. What was the deal with transforming vehicles? I mean if I am racing I want to concentrate on the track not on my ride. It looked to me then that sonic was a party game. More about having fun with your friends rather than racing at breakneck speed. I did not think that it was my type of game and I let it pass. So when sega gave away all stars this month for free on ps+ I downloaded it just out of curiosity, quite sure that I won't like it that much.  After playing about 15 hrs of the game one thing that I can say with certainty is how wrong first impressions can be.</p></div>

        <div><p>A few days back I wrote a <a href="http://www.staticshin.com/node-js-websocket-blues">post</a> in which I outlined a problem that I encountered while using web sockets in node js. Long story short I had trouble managing socket connections in node js. For instance there was no standard way to send a data to a particular socket. The only way was to store the active socket connections in an object and then query the object to get the socket that you want to communicate to.</p><p>While this solution worked it had problems. First of all it was not a very elegant way to do things. My code grew a lot and it was difficult to handle all the edge cases (especially keeping track of socket's life). Another problem was that due to the nature of the work what I wrote was essentially blocking code. There was no way out of looping over objects and performing cpu intensive tasks on it and this scared me. </p></div>

        <div><p>One thing that troubled me while I was learning erlang was the punctuation syntax of the language. While most languages have a single terminator between statements erlang has 3.
