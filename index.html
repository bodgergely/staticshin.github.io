The <em>mulshi</em> lake towards which we were headed is an artificial lake  created by the run off water from the <em>Mulshi</em> dam. We had little trouble reaching our destination when we decided to take directions from the locals instead of relying on google maps, much to the annoyance of my friend (Anirudh). He is a true believer of goolge maps and wanted to follow along the suggested path but he conceded after 45 mins of driving in circles which brought us, in a roundabout way, to the same road that the locals had advised us to take in the first place.</p></div>

	<div class="postMeta">-Tue Feb 24 2015</div>
	<div><p>The author(Prof Gray) starts by discussing the nature of human intercourse throughout the civilization. People have always maintained the concept of "right and wrong".What a person ought to do. And what a person should refrain from doing. That much is clear.  </p><p>Since we have always held the notion of right, it becomes difficult to explain what a right actually is from the perspective of the legal science. The ambiguity of a language presents an obstacle to our understanding the term right as a concept of law.</p></div>

	<div class="postMeta">-Fri Feb 13 2015</div>
	<div><p>All things considered is a collection of essays by GK Chesterton on a variety of topics. Before this I had only read him in the prefaces he wrote for some of Charles Dickens' books. And I remembered a few quotes from "The man who was Thursday" that I read in Deus Ex. But more or less I was (and still am) unfamiliar with his work . So I was not sure what to expect or where to start with All Things Considered. The essays are unrelated so I picked one which looked a bit inviting <em>"The fallacy of success"</em> :</p><p>The fallacy of success is a critique on the self help books that were around during his time. The author makes his stand clear from the first line itself calling them "sincerely and solemnly... the silliest among men". His argument being that these so called success books teach nothing about how to succeed but only manage to convey to the reader such useless facts like "Games are won by winners" . First he questions what success actually means. For him "A millionaire has succeeded in being a millionaire and a donkey has succeeded in being a donkey". I must admit that I nodded in approval because I found his reasoning quite solid. Then he assumes that even if by success these writers meant "money and fame" they have failed to convey anything useful because to succeed in any occupation there are only two ways "By doing very good work. Or by cheating" both of them requiring no further explanation. He comes to the conclusion that all these books teach are viler passions of "avarice and pride" and only succeed in making people "snobbish". He ends by saying that temperance is a virtue and that while it may not help a man to become rich but it will help him gain self respect. All in all this essay made a good first impression on me and I decided to read other ones. </p></div>

	<div><p>Dearest Readers,</p><p>It was the year of 1717 or of 1818, I am not quite sure which since it was some time ago, that I first started staticshin. I didn't have a means of delivering my writing to you so I devised a peculiar delivery technique, which has since grown into a tradition. The service which is know known as the "kite mail" was first started by me in the year of 1717 or of 1818, I can't be sure because it was long long ago, to deliver my articles to you since I did not have any means of delivery. Any way I will not bore you with the details since almost everyone delivers the post by the "kite mail" method and you all must be quite familiar with it.   </p></div>

Are you having trouble finding something to appreciate? Well I don't blame you to be honest. The film deals with a very sensitive issue about nicotine lobbyists fighting to protect(?) the rights of smokers. Now the subject itself is enough to cast the movie into all kinds of controversies which would lead one to assume that the makers of the movie would want to go for a very innocuous title. Some thing like ... I don't know maybe Nick? or Puff? you know something that makes it easy to talk about. They don't pull any punches though. And there is the title of the movie in bold "Thank you for smoking!". </p></div>

	<div><p>House and Wilson on a road trip? Sounds too good to be true to me. Consider the facts. Wilson has cancer. Prognosis 5 months. House is facing the prospect of going back to jail to serve a sentence of 6 months. And he is emotionally unstable (as emotionally unstable as a man like house can be). He is trying to make one of his patients understand the importance of life by strangling him (falling well short of consummation),saving his other patient who is quite sick, trying to teach Foreman a lesson for being supportive, trapped in a fire, hallucinating and then finally coming to his senses and then desperately trying to escape and then.... an explosion.Cut to a bright well lit room, a big smiling picture of Gregory House and an assembly of his friends (?) remembering how a great man he was. Except Wilson, his one true friend. For him house was an ass. </p><p>But it seems like house is not dead after all. He managed to escape through the back door(?) and he cheerfully decides to spend whatever time is left with Wilson. Sounds kind of fantastic. I have two theories about the last episode of House MD.</p></div>

	<div><p>A very close friend of mine, we go way back, got married this year. We hadn't seen each other in months and one night he comes to my place and says "Akshat come outside I've got something to tell you". With him it's always like this, he likes to leave conversations on a dramatic pause. You know it's the same trick that <em>agatha christie</em> employs in her novels. When the dialogue tends to get exciting and the reader is about to discover some critical clue that may lead him to the murderer she will leave the sentence hanging with a "....". While I quite enjoy these breaks in conversation in her books I don't really like it when any one else does it. Take for example what my friend said to me when he came to my place on that night: --- "Akshat come outside I've got something to tell you". What am I supposed to make of this? He wants me outside, okay but it was quite chilly I was all warm inside so didn't quite feel like going out. But before I could ask him what the matter was all about he hangs up. So I put on my jacket and proceed to go out quite determined to tell him that this would not do. </p><p>I go outside we shake hands and I say to him "What's up?" you know small talk before I tell him that I don't quite appreciate him hanging upon me before telling me whole thing and I don't really like going outside when it's warm inside to know the whole thing. And he says to me " <em>Bhai</em> Akshat I'm getting married". So I laugh and he says "No really!". By the earnest expression on his face I believed him. But I didn't quite know what to say to him. Congratulations were in order so I congratulated him and he said "get in we've got to give a few invitations."  </p></div>

	<div><p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7507/15206240134_6ae7161dd6_o.jpg" alt="an orbit presentation"></p><p>Most time travel stories follow the basic formula laid down by HG Wells in <em>The Time machine</em>. You have a brilliant scientist who somehow manages to cobble up a machine capable of travelling in time. Then the aforementioned scientist uses his machine to travel in time and pokes his nose in the business of people who are not from his generation. Well to be fair, I suppose, that can't be helped. One would assume that a scientist who has a capability of creating the time machine would perhaps be a little curious and being a little curious our scientist would probably want to "connect" with the people of the past/future. One can also assume that the age old saying "Curiosity killed the cat"  holds as well in the future or in the past as it does in the present time. </p></div>

	<div><blockquote><p>The human being created civilization not because of willingness but of a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning. The basic human need to be watched was once satisfied by God. Now, the same functionality can be replicated with data-mining algorithms.</p></blockquote><p>JC Denton. Odd name for a video game character. Sounds too bureaucratic. Like a government executive working 9-5 arranging files for his superiors. First few minutes with Deus Ex left me with mixed feelings about the game. It didn't really feel like an fps. It was too slow.  And the main character seemed to be devoid of any personality. My first impression of JC was not too far from the mark either. He was indeed a government agent. Working for UNATCO. The United Nations anti terrorist coalition. But the world was dark and I sensed a conspiracy bubbling underneath the surface so I kept on playing. </p></div>
