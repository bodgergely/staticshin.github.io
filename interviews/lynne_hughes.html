      <h1>A luxury taste of Cornwall with Lynne Hughes</h1>
      <div class="col-8-12">
	<div class="intro">
	  <small> Lynne Hughes is the founder of
            <a href="http://immaculette.com" target="_blank">Immaculette</a>
	    a Cornwall community created with twin purposes of promoting the local
	    industries and to provide amazing holiday experiences to the visitors. She
	    believes that a sense of discovery forms an important part of a holiday.
	    A feeling which seems to have been lost in a commoditized &quot;holiday package&quot;.

	    Lynne offers something different. She offers an unrushed vacation. She gives you
	    an opportunity to ease into Cornwall.
	    To calmly breathe in it&apos;s fresh air and to soak in it&apos;s ambience.
	    She gives you a chance to make Cornwall your own. 
	    And she does all this while promoting the small industries of Cornwall.
	    Making sure that their contributions are recognized. Impressive if you ask us.

	    So  we couldn&apos;t let an opportunity to interview her pass.
	    We contacted her through her <a href="https://twitter.com/lynnedhughes" target="_blank">twitter</a>
	    account and well... here we are :)
	  </small>
	</div>
	<p><em>Q: Lynne, what makes Cornwall special?</em></p>
	<p>
	  Cornwall in particular has spectacular beaches, coastal walks and an air of ancient
	  history..which is slowly being lost through big corporate intervention.
	  They produce some of the best artisan and local delicacies.
	  Farms are loved and animals are free.
	  Cornwall offers tranquility where you can practically have a beach to
	  yourself and if you charter a boat you can find isolated hidden bays and clear deep water.
	  You can visit local pubs and find real Celtic warmth and toe tapping music under
	  low old beams in lopsided inns.
	  The majority of celebrity chefs have their restaurants in Cornwall
	  Rick Stein, Jamie Oliver, Marco Pierre White.
	  The fresh fish which is caught daily is superbly cooked for you to enjoy.
	  Many celebrities live or spend time in Cornwall it is a real getaway.
	</p>


        <p><em>Q:Wonderful! Was it always like this though? How was Cornwall in the good old days? Before it became a
	    popular tourist destination?</em></p>

	<p>Many moons ago Cornwall flourished through fishing and the tin mines.
	  After the value of tin subsided and eventually people grew to know about the warm sea air and beautiful coastal scenery tourism became more and more of an attraction..
	  It was miles away from the sea side attraction like Brighton&apos;s pier it was rural with a local
	  way of life that still is kept going today although the tiny quaint
	  villages are now more full with arts and gift shops for the ever building tourism.
	  There is an abundance of sea trips,  international surfing, classic sailing races,
	  right down to be able to potter up a tranquil river all to yourself
	  and lose yourself in the delights of Cornwall rivers wild life.
	  So Cornwall offers history, scenery, great produce, an abundance of activities and
	  most of all immaculettes little secrets...</p>
	<p>
	  <em>Q:What is a <a href="http://www.aluxurytasteofcornwall.co.uk/about_us.html" target="_blank">
	      &quot;Self catering service&quot;</a>? </em>
	</p>
        <p>
	  Immaculette can increase the turnover substantially and sustainably through a niche market.

	  The niche market is &apos;high end luxury self catering.&apos;

	  Through this market second home owners and holiday home owners ,
	  who charge high significant holiday rent and then remove that revenue away from the area ,have in my eyes, a significant responsibility ,to care for their  environment of which they are encouraging visitors to come and enjoy and discover the local activities and feel like part of the community.</p>
        <p>
	  <em>Q: Does it enhance the experience of the tourists?
	    What is your motivation behind promoting small scale industries of Cornwall?</em>
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are thousands of self catering properties occupied by so many weeks of the year, in cornwall alone, if immaculette can provide locally sourced goods as an  exquisite gift of goods for the visitor to enjoy on arrival ,which very possibly they may not come across by chance and enhance added value to their holiday experience .This can substancially &apos;make a difference&apos; to the &apos;growth&apos; of small business ,which sustainably can create local jobs. Surely this makes sence not only in cornwall but in rural areas around the world to encourage.

	</p>

	<p>
	  So the intention of Immaculette&apos;s movement is to support and sustain rural small
	  business who need as much support as they can get and hopefully add
	  significantly to the future growth of communities..
	</p>


	<p><em>Q:Does the tourism ever feel like an intrusion to the locals? How have the locals adapted?</em></p>
	<p>
	  The way the locals have adapted is clearly by offering tours and reopening up
	  the history for example Poldark.com and reinventing how people used to live.
