###The road to mulshi dam(the western ghats)

Once you leave the main city (nigri,Pune) the road to *mulshi* runs in one uninterrupted stretch through the western ghats. The *mulshi* lake towards which we were headed is an artificial lake lake created by the run off water from the *Mulshi* dam. We had little trouble reaching our destination when we decided to take directions from the locals instead of relying on google maps, much to the annoyance of my friend (Anirudh). He is a true believer of goolge maps and wanted to follow along the suggested path but he conceded after 45 mins of driving which brought us to the same road that the local people had hinted on.

As I said the road runs through the western ghats and it makes for a very delightful scenery. To our left we had we had the hills some tall some short but all them very imposing. To our right we had a valley in which we could see the lake in the distance. We were looking for a good spot to get as close to the lake as we could. We found one near a solar power plant.

The lake at that point was closest to the road. So we decided to head in. Carefully navigating across a few boulders we found ourselves at the edge of the lake. It spread far. The water was still but it looked quite fresh and blue. I remarked to Anirudh how serene it looked and he begged me to stop talking and let him be "in the moment".

Well he was in the moment all right. One second he was taking in deep breaths of the fresh air and the other he jumped out of his clothes and into the lake. I considered this to be a bit reckless. I reminded him of the episodes of river monsters where the presenter finds quite dangerous animals in calm unsuspecting waters. My,I thought quite genuine, concern was dismissed with a shrug of shoulders and he proceed to give me a lecture on how we have lost touch with nature and we need to reconnect.

His words spread me into action and I myself jumped into the lake. Though unlike Anirudh I had no intention of covering myself in mud for a "natural bath". I thought that he took the whole reconnecting with the nature thing a bit too far when he started drinking the water from the lake. I pointed out to him that it was quite possible that the same water could have been used by the locals to bathe their buffaloes. But he did't care. I did't press much either. We were in good spirits and after my "water only" and Anirudh's "water and mud" bath we were both feeling quite refresed. So we decided to move on to our next destination.

Nothing much of intrest occured untill our next destination but scattered througut the road we found warning signs forbidding the entry into the lake due to "reptiles, weeds, quicksand and powerful undercurrents". Needless to say that besides refreshed we felt quite adventrous an maybe even a bit gallant. But I suppose that could have been due to the lord of the rings soundtrack playing in our ears. 

### Towards kashid
We were headed to *kashid* beach. It was some 100 kms from the lake. The road among the mountains continued to be smooth and scenic. In between we stopped for *vada pao* and pineapple juice. Once we left the hills and moved though the vlillages the condition of the roads detriorated quite considerably. It was a bit difficult to drive but we wanted to be at the beach befor ehte sunset so we kept on. And it got beter, anyways, once we left the villages and were back among the mountains again.

Along the way we found a couple selling watermelons so we stopped to get some. Talking to them we found out that these watermelons were quite special. "Not like those big tateless ones they sold in the cities". These were called "sugar babies" and were grown on the farm behind the stall. The couple said that people from far off places came to them to buy these sugar babies once they acquired a taste for them. They had also petted an abandoned ox who helped them keep the premises clean by gulping down the leftovers. They were quite good I must admit. The kashid beach was near know. 9 km's only. I could smell the water.

### Kashid

We reached kashid at around 2. So we had plenty of time before it was sunset. Anirudh told me all about the mangroves and how they are used in fish farming. Mangroves can grown in salt water. It has roots above the surface of the water so it can provides the fishes a good spot to lay thier eggs. Quite fascinating these mangroves are.

Kashid beach was glorious.  

Nature calls my firend. Several times. I ask wheter he got too close to her in the day. He blurbs out some incrompehesible reply.

### Back to nigri

We head back t nigri. We lay low for a week. We are ready again to travel. In a bus without google maps to ancient India.
