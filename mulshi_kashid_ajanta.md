###The road to mulshi dam(the western ghats)

Once you leave the main city (nigri,Pune) the road to *mulshi* runs in one uninterrupted stretch through the western ghats. The *mulshi* lake towards which we were headed is an artificial lake  created by the run off water from the *Mulshi* dam. We had little trouble reaching our destination when we decided to take directions from the locals instead of relying on google maps, much to the annoyance of my friend (Anirudh). He is a true believer of goolge maps and wanted to follow along the suggested path but he conceded after 45 mins of driving in cirlces which brought us, in a roundabout way, to the same road that the locals had advised us to take in the first place.

As I said the road runs through the western ghats and it makes for a very delightful scenery. To our left we had we had the hills some tall, some short, but all them very imposing. I remarked to my friend that these hills looked like helmets of some giant soldiers gurading the sacred lake, but that might have been the effect of lord of the ring's soundtrack in my ears .To our right we had a valley in which we could see the lake in the distance. We were looking for a good spot to get as close to it as we could. We found one near a solar power plant. So we decided to head in.

 Carefully navigating across the boulders we found ourselves at the edge. It spread far. The water was still but it looked quite fresh and blue. I remarked to Anirudh how serene it looked but he begged me to stop talking and let him be "in the moment".

Well he was in the moment all right. One second he was taking in deep breaths of the fresh air and in the other he jumped out of his clothes and into the lake. I considered this to be a bit reckless. I reminded him of the episodes of "River Monsters" where the Jermy Wade finds quite dangerous animals in calm unsuspecting waters. My,I thought quite genuine, concern was dismissed with a wave of hands and he proceed to give me a lecture on how we have lost touch with nature and how important it is for us to reconnect. 

His words spurred me into action and I myself jumped into the lake. Though unlike Anirudh I had no intention of covering myself in mud for a "natural bath". Infact I thought that he took the whole reconnecting with the nature thing a bit too far when he started drinking the water from the lake. I pointed out to him that it was quite possible that the same water could have been used by the locals to bathe their buffaloes. My deduction based on the very fresh cow dung I had accidently stepped into earlier. But he did't care. I did't press much either. We were in good spirits and after my "water only" and Anirudh's "water and mud" bath we were both feeling quite refresed. So we decided to move on to our next destination.

Nothing much of intrest occured untill our next destination but scattered througut the road we found warning signs forbidding the entry into the lake due to "reptiles, weeds, quicksand and powerful undercurrents". Needless to say that besides refreshed we felt quite adventrous an maybe even a bit gallant. But I suppose that could have been due to the lord of the rings soundtrack playing in our ears. 

### Towards kashid
We were headed to *kashid* beach. It was some 100 kms from the lake. The road among the mountains continued to be smooth and scenic. In between we stopped for *vada pao* and pineapple juice. Once we left the hills and moved though the vlillages the condition of the roads detriorated quite considerably. It was a bit difficult to drive but we wanted to be at the beach before the sunset so we kept on. And it got beter anyway, once we left the villages, and were back among the mountains again.

Along the way we found a couple selling watermelons so we stopped to get some. Talking to them we found out that these watermelons were quite special. "Not like those vapid things they sell in the cities". These were called "sugar babies" and were grown on the farm behind the stall. The couple said that people from far off places came to them to buy these sugar babies once they acquired a taste for them. They had also petted an abandoned ox who helped them keep the premises clean by gulping down the leftovers. They were quite good I must admit. The kashid beach was near know. 9 km's only. I could almost smell the sand.

### Kashid

We reached kashid at around 2 P.M. So we had plenty of time before it was sunset. Anirudh told me all about the mangroves and how they are used in fish farming on the way. Mangroves can grow in saline water. It has roots above the surface of the water so it can provide the fishes a good spot to lay their eggs. It is also said that mangroves help preventing coastal soil erosion and act as first barriers to tidal waves and tsunamis. We saw some of these mangrove trees up close. Quite fascinating they were.

Kashid beach was glorious. The spot we found had very few rocks. Only the soft sand, with a few quite sharp shells embedded in it, seperated us from the water. People on the beach, as I have had the opportunity to observe a couple of times before, can be divided into two groups:-

Group 1-- the people in these group are quite content in staying as far away from the water possible. On the beach they lay thier roots in a sunny spot. Once they do that it is impossible to mkae them move. You have some hope however if you manage to catch one while they are still tilling the soil, so to speak. Quite naturally these walking walnuts are reluctant to go in and have to be in some cases dragged and in other carried, against thier wishes, to even get the tip of their body wet. It is quite a sight to observe a member of this group from up close. They will scream, run, twist and turn in short to anything in their power to keep themselves dry. Once wet however these people loosen up and at least feign to enjoy water. A clear tell of a member of this tribe is that they have their clothes on even in the water.

Group -2: The people in this group live by the rule "He who must search for pearls must dive below". You can usually spot the group 2 brethern deep into the sea father than anyone else. They don't really care for the red flag that marks the boundary of the "safe zone". They go in deeper and deeper. In a sense they are the leaders of human race, reponsible for all of it's glory. Their courage inspires lesser men to walk the treachrous road. They are the "troublesome tribe" the lifeguards talk about on their lunch break.



Nature calls my firend. Several times. I ask wheter he got too close to her in the day. He blurbs out some incrompehesible reply.

### Back to nigri

We head back t nigri. We lay low for a week. We are ready again to travel. In a bus without google maps to ancient India.
