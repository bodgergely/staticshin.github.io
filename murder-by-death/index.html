      <h1>Murder by death</h1>
      <span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma,  Tue Dec 24 2013</span>
      <div class="postBody"><p>The facts are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>two two twain</em>  residence has an unlimited supply of stone gargoyles.</li>
<li>The <em>two two twain</em> residence has a butler.</li>
<li>The butler is blind.</li>
<li>The doorbell is quite loud.</li>
<li>In fact it is a shriek. On rainy days it produces a lasting impression on the visitor.</li>
<li>The day, with which we are concerned, was a rainy day. And there were many visitors expected.</li>
<li>Consequently many shrieks were heard in the <em>two two twain</em> residence that day.</li>
<li>One of those shrieks was produced by an actual woman.</li>
<li>But that was due to the unnerving incident at the front gate followed by an unnerving incident at the room that left Mrs Charleston thoroughly unsettled and she gave out a shriek.</li>
<li>Mrs Marbles takes care of her nurse. </li>
<li>She is by profession a detective.</li>
<li>In fact every visitor in the <em>two two twain</em> residence is a detective.</li>
<li>They are here to solve a crime that has not been committed <strong>yet</strong>.</li>
<li>But they shall have dinner first.  </li>
<li>The butler is given the charge of a deaf cook to prepare the meal for the guests of the <em>two two twain</em> residence. </li>
<li>The cook is not only deaf but also dumb and can neither read nor write.</li>
<li>Hence she just sits on a chair all while the butler is under the impression that she is cooking.</li>
<li>The butler meanwhile assumes that the preparations are "light on seasoning" and goes on to serve the dishes. </li>
<li>M. Pierre who has been hungry since he arrived is offended that there is nothing to serve. </li>
<li>The clock strikes 11.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this point on wards my memory is a bit hazy and I can not recollect the actual circumstances surrounding the events that took place after 11. I will try my best to give a record of the facts but they can not be trusted. Better watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">the movie</a> for your self</p>
<ul>
<li>The master of <em>two two twain </em> residence introduces himself.</li>
<li>A murder is announced.</li>
<li>The murderer still lurks in the dark. </li>
<li>The prize money is revealed.</li>
<li>The master retires into the adjoining room. </li>
<li>The butler is dead.</li>
<li>His clothes are missing.</li>
<li>Detectives investigate.</li>
<li>A knife is missing. </li>
<li>The mystery of two dining halls!</li>
<li>The mystery of two bathrooms!</li>
<li>The puzzle of the <em>two two twain</em> residence.</li>
<li>The butlers clothes reappear.</li>
<li>The butler however disappears. </li>
<li>The detectives join hands and pray.</li>
<li>Another murder is committed despite their prayers. </li>
<li>The detectives retire to their bed rooms.</li>
<li>Attempt is made to kill all of them.</li>
<li>The attempt is unsuccessful.</li>
</ul>
<p>The solution to mystery by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">detective 1</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">detective 2</a>,<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">detective 3</a>,<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">detective  4</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">detective 5</a>.</p>
<p>It is accepted that all solutions are correct ! and yet the crime remains unsolved.  Can you solve it ? </p>
