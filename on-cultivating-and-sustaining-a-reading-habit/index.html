      <h1>On cultivating and sustaining a reading habit</h1>
      <span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma,  Sun May 25 2014</span>
      <div class="postBody"><p>Reading is an endangered habit. For many people spending time with a book is
probably the most dreadful, boring exercise in the world. If you are
one of those people who have stumbled upon this article I know what you are probably thinking
yeah nice way to help me  "cultivate a reading habit" by making me read this blog post! I assure you that your
cynicism is not lost on me. There is already a lot written elsewhere on the internet that
lists all the ways one can develop a reading habit. What I intend to do however
is explore the question "why don't some people like to read?" Maybe it will help you understand
why you are averse to reading and you can take effective steps to combat that feeling.</p>
<p>Generally speaking most reading material can be classified into fictional and non fictional work.
Reading non fictional books is considered as an important exercise that helps in the
growth of an individual. Consequently most people living in a modern society read through
a significant number of non fictional books before they turn 20. Now most of these texts
are usually a part of curriculum of whatever course  a person chooses during his/her education.
After the education completes the individual depending upon profession he is in may
or may not have to read non-fictional books. For instance a lawyer or a professor, due to the nature of
his profession, will <em>have</em> to read more than a musician. But it's safe to assume that in a modern
society every one who has access to education reads (whether willing or unwillingly)
lots of non fictional  books.</p>
<p>Reading fictional books on the other hand is considered to be a recreational activity, unless
one has enrolled in a course that has fictional subjects as a part of the curriculum. As
we move on and chose a profession for ourselves the type of books that we read are most likely
to not read are fictional books. Since if our profession mandates reading it will be of
non fictional nature (once more making the assumption that one is not in a creative profession
as writing or movies) and if it does not, the type of books that we won't read are fictional books.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the benefit of reading a fictional
book is not immediately apparent. For instance reading a latest research paper on heart disease
has an immediate benefit of knowing what cause the disease of heart. Any one who
is suffering from heart disease will casually pick up the journal
and start reading with immense interest. But apparently there is nothing
to gain by reading say <em>The three men in a boat (Not to say anything of the dog!)</em>.
So we can narrow down our question to "Why don't some people like to read fiction?"</p>
<p>Is there a specific reason that I say fiction? Yes. Take an example of
a journal on advanced image processing techniques, a person passing by will probably ignore
that journal unless that person has an active interest in image processing. Fictional work
on the other hand can <strong>at the very least</strong> be a source of entertainment --pleasure. So while there is a good
reason that one would not like to read a book that is boring ( to that person) but
what could be the reason to not read something that could perhaps be entertaining?</p>
<p>Surely many of you have noticed it as well that a person would willingly watch a
Harry Potter on TV but would not feel inclined to read the book. And so finally I get to the point:-</p>
<p><strong>Reading involves active participation.</strong></p>
<p>Reading fiction is unlike any other form of entertainment. You are being fed pieces of
information which then you have to assemble in your own mind for it to make any sense.
One of the most common reasons that people give up on a book is that they are unable
to <em>see</em> what the author is trying to say. Put another way they are unable to
form a mental picture from the words of the author.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that the book one is reading is challenging. The ideas presented and the expression used
is foreign to the reader and he/she is unable to relate to and hence understand what the author is trying to say.
That is the reader in unable to engage and participate in the world that author has created.
But unfortunately many people promptly give up on a book if it faintly strains
their faculties. Here are some the books that I would have missed out on if I
gave up on them after my first day of reading</p>
<ol>
<li>Gone with the wind</li>
<li>The count of Monte Cristo</li>
<li>The Three Musketeers</li>
<li>Hard Times</li>
<li>Frankenstein</li>
</ol>
<p>(And those are very good books in case you are wondering)</p>
<p>What I am trying to say here is that there will always be books that are
set in a period that you have never been to before. There will always be
books that are written in a style that you have never read before. There will
always be books that will evoke a sensation such as you have never felt
before. Don't be quick to dismiss them. Give it some time. Work at it to
discover what the author is really trying to say. Isn't that the purpose of
reading any way? To discover something new. Does that not excite you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'what is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversations?'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every one likes good stories. I go watch movies with friends,
who wouldn't be caught dead with a book and yet they enjoy
cinema. So while they like watching a good story they don't enjoy reading it.
An excuse that is often put forward is "who has time to read an entire book".</p>
<p>Now I understand that we live in a rushed world and medium has evolved to provide
us with rushed entertainment but it's narrow minded to think of all books
as weighty tomes that require weeks to finish. For people who are in a hurry
there is no better way to get into a reading habit that acquiring a taste for short stories.
I will even help you by listing some classics</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Are you in a mood for a quick mystery? How about some (free) <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1661/1661-h/1661-h.htm">Sherlock Holmes</a>?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Are you looking for a quick laugh? How about some (free) <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27284/27284-h/27284-h.htm">F. Anstey</a>?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do you like depressing tales? How about some (free) <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/13437/pg13437.html">Russian short stories</a>?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But feel free to ignore my list and drown you self in the
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">Gutenberg</a> library where you will find
books on every possible topic and chose one that suits you best.</p>
<p>If you still don't like reading books  I suggest that
you pick up an audio book. Listening to audio is not as demanding as reading and it might 
make you more comfortable and get you started on reading.</p>
<p>If you have read this article to the end (thank you by the way) you will notice that I have not once brought
up the benefits of reading books. The reason is simple.
While there are obvious benefits to reading they
are often exaggerated. Reading a book will not make you scholar,
though it might set you on the right path.
There is nothing scholarly about people who read.
They just spend more time with books than
people who don't and hence find it easier to get into different types of books.
How about you just start reading for entertainment and discover for
yourself the changes it brings in you? If you feel smarter
then it's a bonus you have had a good time reading already!</p>
<p>So if it has been a long time since you read and you don't know where to begin then I suggest that
you pick up a short story.
Preferably one that will be over in 20 minutes so that it  does not require that much of time
investment. Plus there are a wide variety of short stories available so you can experiment
and see what kind of books you like.</p>
<p>But please do not give up on reading just because you read some books before that you did not like.
Or because it takes too much time.
Or because it's something new.
Or whatever excuse that you make.</p>
