        <p>The open apis of facebook and twitter are successful because they allow the developers to build applicaitons that can serve hundreds of millions of users. The apis of AWS are popular because they are accessible to anyone with internet.The apis of Mailchimp are popular because it's useful to anyone who wants to market on the internet.  The common theme amongst all successful api plantrofrms is that they are </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Universally Accessible</li>
            <li>Have a wide veriety of uses</li>
            <li>Have a very broad reach</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are not many instances of popular hyperlocal apis. Specialization tends to limit both the usefullness and the outreach of your platform. The goal of any open api platform is to increase the outreach of your services. But that works under the aussmption that the service is supported by the platform itself. As an example you can request provisioning of AWS instances from the command line using the AWS api but it wouldn't have any meaning if the api request to provision a new server were not supported by the operation of actually creating a new instance on your behalf. Consider again that a public api on the internet comes with the expectation that it's accessible to and can be used by anyone with internet.</p>
        <p>As a programmer there's nothing more delightful for me than being able to play with a new api. <!-- Add a few lines about about banking apis and apis of mastercard and visa --></p>
        <p><strong>Demographics</strong></p>
        <p>It's clear that the api is being tragetted at millenials even though the concentration of wealth is with people in another age bracket all together. While it's true that the messaging apps can get away with a product that is built to appeal to the youth it would make sense to make banking applicaitons speak to expereince. To people who can actually spend money. </p>
        <p><strong>Promotional PPIs</strong></p>
        <p>Despite what everyone says print media is still a very popular method of advertisement. <!-- Put some numbers in here --></p>
