        <p>The open apis of facebook and twitter are successful because they allow the developers to build applicaitons that can serve hundreds of millions of users. The apis of AWS are popular because they are accessible to anyone with internet.The apis of Mailchimp are popular because it's useful to anyone who wants to market on the internet.  The common theme amongst all successful api plantrofrms is that they are </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Universally Accessible</li>
            <li>Have a wide veriety of uses</li>
            <li>Have a very broad reach</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are not many instances of popular hyperlocal apis. Specialization tends to limit both the usefullness and the outreach of your platform. The goal of any open api platform is to increase the outreach of your services. But that works under the aussmption that the service is supported by the platform itself. As an example you can request provisioning of AWS instances from the command line using the AWS api but it wouldn't have any meaning if the api request to provision a new server were not supported by the operation of actually creating a new instance on your behalf. Consider again that a public api on the internet comes with the expectation that it's accessible to and can be used by anyone with internet.</p>
        <p>As a programmer there's nothing more delightful for me than being able to play with a new api. As an example earlier this year VISA and mastercard made their apis open. I poured through the docs to see what I can do with it and how I can make use of it in my existing applicaitons, however I was disappointed to find that for majority fo the endopoints you need a BIN (Bank Identification number) to be able to use it in production. Now I'm not questioning the reasoning behind such a requirement. Given the sensitive nature of the transactions that are being made it's of utmost importance to be ver careful in allowing the production use of the apis however the price of such carefulness  is that the api looses it's universal appeal that it should have considering the diffusion of both mastercard and visa in the world. And in the same token when it is being said that financial api will be more accessible what is meant is that they will only be more selectively accessible. In other words apis of banks/card manufactureres will not be completely open like that of paypal/facebook/twitter. And given the fact that Banks and card networks always had an api that was selectively accessible we don't have much of an improvement from our previous state.</p>
        <p>Taking the other side of the argument some api proposals like the PSD2 which are ,very rightly, termed as disruptive.The problem is that there's absolutely a need of making banking services more </p>
        <p><strong>Demographics</strong></p>
        <p>It's clear that the api is being tragetted at millenials even though the concentration of wealth is with people in another age bracket all together. While it's true that the messaging apps can get away with a product that is built to appeal to the youth when it comes to banking it would make sense to make applicaitons that speak to expereince. To people who can actually spend money. </p>
        <p><em>"Banks have broad and deep proven data handling and holding
	    capabilities. They have brand profile and brand trust. They have
	    pre-existing infrastructures. Far from being the “targets and
	    victims” of PSD2-driven disruption, banks should own the next
	    steps and shape the digital ecosystem to best reflect their
	    customers’ next generation of needs and their own commercial
	    best interests"</em></p>
        <p><strong>Promotional PPIs</strong></p>
        <p>Despite what everyone says print media is still a very popular method of advertisement. <!-- Put some numbers in here --></p>
