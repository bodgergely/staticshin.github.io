        <p>The open apis of facebook and twitter are successful because they allow the developers to build applicaitons that can serve hundreds of millions of users. The apis of AWS are popular because they are accessible to anyone with internet.The apis of Mailchimp are popular because it's useful to anyone who wants to market on the internet.  The common theme amongst all successful api plantrofrms is that they are </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Are universally accessible</li>
            <li>Have a wide variety of use cases</li>
            <li>Have a very broad reach -- in most cases global.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are not many instances of popular hyperlocal apis. Specialization tends to limit both the usefullness and the outreach of your platform. The goal of any open api platform is to increase the outreach of your services. But that works under the aussmption that the service is supported by the platform itself. As an example you can request provisioning of AWS instances from the command line using the AWS api but it wouldn't have any meaning if the api request to provision a new server were not supported by the operation of actually creating a new instance on your behalf. Consider again that a public api on the internet comes with the expectation that it's accessible to and can be used by anyone with internet.</p>
        <p>As a programmer there's nothing more delightful for me than being able to play with a new api. As an example earlier this year VISA and mastercard made their apis open. I poured through the docs to see what I can do with it and how I can make use of it in my existing applicaitons, however I was disappointed to find that for majority fo the endopoints you need a BIN (Bank Identification number) to be able to use it in production.</p>
	<p> Now I'm not questioning the reasoning behind such a requirement. Given the sensitive nature of the transactions that are being made it's of utmost importance to be ver careful in allowing the production use of the apis however the price of such carefulness  is that the api looses it's universal appeal that it should have considering the diffusion of both mastercard and visa in the world. And in the same token when it is being said that financial api will be more accessible what is meant is that they will only be more selectively accessible. In other words apis of banks/card manufactureres will not be completely open like that of paypal/facebook/twitter. And given the fact that Banks and card networks always had an api that was selectively accessible we don't have much of an improvement from our previous state. Banks don't. And can't for the most part. There is no international bank in the turest sense. Sure there are local branches of "multinatinational" financial institutions but all banks operate within the policies and framework that is set by the host country. So we have a PSD2 that will work well in the EU but won't affect people NA. Simillarly we have a UPI that will work well in India but won't have any impact in South Africa.  The current strategy seems to be pushing for sweeping regulatory change across continents in a hope that banks, governemnts and people will set aside their competitive differences and work towards a better financial future. If only! I do believe in faires and miracles but I'm highly dobutful of a cooperation among banks of the world in a happily ever after ending. There are other ways to attack the problem. </p>
        <p><small>One important insight here is that even with the limitations of accessibility the API's of both mastercard and VISA have a global reach. The lesson to learn here is that somehow the card manufactures have managed to create a global network of data on top of seggregated banks disjointly operating across the world. </small></p>
        <p><strong>Markets</strong></p>
        <p>One way to address the problem of International banking is by tailoring the services towards markets that are already operating internationally and depend upon partnerships and cooperation between numerous complex entities. These entities form natural links that can </p>
        <p><strong>Demographics</strong></p>
        <p>It's clear that the api is being tragetted at millenials even though the concentration of wealth is with people in another age bracket all together. While it's true that the messaging apps can get away with a product that is built to appeal to the youth when it comes to banking it would make sense to make applicaitons that speak to expereince. To people who can actually spend money. </p>

        <p><strong>Promotional PPIs</strong> -- If facebook and google can do it any one can!</p>
        <p>Despite what everyone says print media is still a very popular method of advertisement. <!-- Put some numbers in here --></p>
