	<p>Perhaps the only flaw I can find in this movie is that there are no actual buffaloes involved. I would have appreciated if there were a couple of cameos of my second favorite animal* It would have been a nice touch, I mean to say, to feature a buffalo doing it's usual thing. You know mooing, grazing, wagging it's tail and most importantly contributing to the national manure production. There could have been a close up of it's glaring eyes and intimidating horns for a bit of dramatic effect. Or maybe the scene could have been bit educational showcasing the exceptionally milky productive prowess of the bovine.But one can't always get what he wants.</p>
        <p>Buffalo '66 is a classic. Even without the actual buffaloes.</p>
