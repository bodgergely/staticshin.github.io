        <h1 class="center">Buffallo '66</h1>
        <p>After spending 5 years in prison, for a crime he did not commit, Billy Brown finds himself out of place in the real world. So intimidating is this new found independance to him that he asks the prison guards to let him in again so that he may use the prison facilities to relieve himself. On being denied entry he reluctantly boards the bus and goes to the city where his first contact with people is stiff, confused and erratic. Bufallo '66 introduces Billy to us when he's at his all time low. Prison has weakned him, he appears to be helpless and forsaken, someone who can't even find a place to piss. </p>
        <p>
	  Billy's parents have no idea that Billy has been in prison. Their communication has been limited to the letters that he wrote from jail in which he made up a happy story about being married,very busy with work and in general living a good life. However once out of prison Billy has no idea how to reconcile his truth  with the one he has made his parents to believe. In a desperate move he abducts Layla from a dance class and forces her pose as his wife for a day.</p>
        <p>The interaction between Billy and Layla forms the majority of the movie.  </p>
        <p>As the story progresses Billy's motives true revealed. </p>
        <p>Although the story explores the themes of abduction and murder it still manages to keep the narrative light and funny that beautifully contrasts its dark themes. </p>
        <p>Buffallo '66  is a movie of contradictions. The characters have a tendency to defy the expectations of the viewers. Billy the abductor is a tormented soul under his appearance of bravado. He wants to potray an image of self control an authority but he's indesicive and confused most of the time. On the other hand Layla the abductee is calm,composed in control of herself, helpful and kind. Billy's father who gets irritated quite easily and is always in a bad mood likes to sing and when he does he transforms into a respendant figure of joy and goodness. Billy's mother who appears to love her son is not all that fond of him and infact secretly bears a grudge against him for being born on the day of big league match causing her to miss it.</p>
	<p>The only flaw I can find in this movie is that there are no actual buffaloes involved. I would have appreciated if there were a couple of cameos of my second favorite animal*. I believe it would have been a nice touch, I mean to say, to feature a buffalo doing it's usual thing. You know mooing, grazing, wagging it's tail and perhaps most importantly contributing to the national manure production. There could have been a close up of it's glaring eyes and intimidating horns for a bit of a dramatic effect. Or maybe the scene could have been  educational in nature showcasing the exceptionally milky productive prowess of the bovine. But one can't always get what one wants.</p>
        <p>Buffalo '66 is a classic. Even without the actual buffaloes.</p>
