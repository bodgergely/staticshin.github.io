After reading Prof. Gray's views on rights an duties I remembered reading about
our Constitution in school.  Among other things there
was a phrase that was often repeated by our
teacher:- "Fundamental rights and duties".

But according to Prof Gray a duty can exist without a right but a right
can only exist with respect to a duty. The question that I am asking myself is
a right truly fundamental? I will explain what I mean...

If right is co relative of duty. And if without duty there can be no right
is it wrong to say that all rights are derived from duties? And if the rights
are derived from duties can they be called fundamental? 

Consider the right to equality before a court of law.  Can I not put it 
another way and say that it is the duty of a court of law to treat every person as 
equal. 

Similarly if I take the right to education then can I not say that 
it is the duty of state to not deny me education? 

Can not all rights be replaced by the duties? And if so could  it mean that
the duties are essential and rights are just what follows.

Why then is the word right used when a duty could have been 
used to the same effect? Prof Gray himself admits that the 
word right is difficult to explain as it can have different meanings for ex: 
right as in not wrong. 

The explanation that I have is that when you say that you have a certain
right like the right of education the onus is upon the holder of the
right to exercise that right or not. He can choose to exercise it
or he can choose to waive it. But duties have to be fulfilled. There is no
will in a duty.

The state for example can protect my right to education if it has
been violated. But the state can not guarantee me education. The state
only guarantees that if I choose to get an education then it can not be denied
to me.

The onus of exercising my right is upon me. That much I understand. But why
call it fundamental. The duty to defend my right education is essential.
and my right is only implied. The duty to treat me as an equal in a court
is fundamental and my right to be treated as an equal is only implied. 

Or maybe I am wrong in my conclusion. Because if there were only fundamental
duties and no rights then I would not be able to exercise them. Sure it is
the duty of the state to protect my education but if I had no right
could I ask the state that I need my education to be protected?

I think I am just going in circles here. This chain of thought is
pointless.
