        <h1 class="center">Chapora Fort</h1>
        <p>The legend goes that in 1684, Sambhaji, the mighty Martha ruler, along with his troops climbed the Chapora fort with the help of monitor lizards causing the Portugese to surrender without a fight. The fort was built by the Portugese on the top of a small hill as a watch post commanding an unobstructed view in all the four directions. Conflicts soon arose and the fort fell back in the hands of Portugese. It continued to change hands until the year 1892 when it became redundant and was was finally abandoned.</p>
        <p>What remains now are just ruins. On the edges one can make out the outlines of the walls that once defended the fort. Within one can see a few graves scattered about,the remnants of a church and rocks lying all over the place. Beyond the walls one can see the Arabian sea stretching out to infinity on one side (lined by the Morjim and Vagator beaches) and the Chapora river on the other. </p>

        <p></p>
    <p>In a few moments of bliss the sun goes down, the winds get stronger and the waves crash harder. Before you know it, the night takes over and as the clouds move past the moon gleaming from across the sea, the wild spirit howls.</p>
