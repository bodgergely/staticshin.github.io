    	<h1 class="center">Consumer ethics in thank you for smoking</h1>
        <p>Recently I came upon this paper ,by Stacy Thompson, called 
	  <a href="http://www.film-philosophy.com/2009v13n1/thompson.pdf">Consumer ethics in thank you for smoking</a>. 
	  The subject matter of this piece is  Nick Naylor, the protagonist of the movie 
	  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/">Thank you for smoking </a> and the goal is to determine whether 
	  the actions of Nick were ethical or not. To determine morality of Nick his actions were judged against ethical codes laid down by great philosophers such as Aristotle and Kierkegaard. The paper itself is very well written and if you haven't already you should read it. But there were a few things I found a bit off and decided to an analysis myself taking Stacy's work as the base.
