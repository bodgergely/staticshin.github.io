    	<h1 class="center">Consumer ethics in Thank you for smoking</h1>
        <p>Recently I came upon this paper ,by Stacy Thompson, called 
	  <a href="http://www.film-philosophy.com/2009v13n1/thompson.pdf">Consumer ethics in thank you for smoking</a>. 
	  The subject matter of this piece is  Nick Naylor, the protagonist in
	  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/">Thank you for smoking </a> and the goal is to find out whether 
	  Nick acted ethically or not. To determine that, Nick's actions are judged against moral guidelines laid down by great philosophers such as Aristotle and Kierkegaard. The paper itself is very well written and if you haven't already you should read it. But there were a few things I found a bit off and so I decided to an
	  analysis myself, taking Stacy's work as the base. 
	<p>
	  Stacy's analysis begins with Nick's response "If he wants to smoke . . . Iâ€™ll buy him his first pack" to senator Finistree's question "When  your  son  turns  18,  will  you  let  him  smoke  if  he wants  to?" The author claims that Nick's response was a bluff. That his son's freedom is seemingly preserved only after he can withstand years of his father's badgering. In other words what he's saying is that Nick's son never really had a choice.</p>
<p>During the same scene ,that the author is talking about, Nick maintained that it is the duty of every parent to educate their children about perlis of smoking. Pasting a skull and bones label on a ciggarette packet is not going to help any one. He goes on to argue that if the committe thinks that ciggarette smoking is evil for causing deaths why not go ahead and put a skull and bones label on cars which cause great number of deaths due to accidents. Or even on cheese packaging which cause death due to high cholsetrol levels, choking the arteries. 
</p>
<p>Second Nick advocated a healthy skepticism even among children who were not yet developed in their critical reasoning abilities. During his presentation in Joey's school Nick more or less asked the children to not trust thier parents on the perlis of smoking and they that should try themselves to find out if smoking does indeed kill. He compares smoking to a harmless exercise like eating chocolates. Would you stop eating chocolates just because someone told you so?</p>
 
<p>These two statements by Nick are contradictory to one another. On one hand he wants to inclulcate a feeling of independant thinking in children by asking them to not take anybody's word at face value and form their own opnions. On the other hand Nick wants the parents to educate thier children about perils of smoking, making their job difficult as a bunch of strong headed "independant thinking" children are hard to reason with and not everyone posesses Nick's gift with the words. Even if they do it's not like teenagers are going to listen to them. Was Nick a hypocrite?</p>
<p>
Maybe. What we need to keep in mind that during his presentation at the school Nick objective was to to tell the students what he does for a living. Nick makes a living by talking. What he did at the school was a demonstration of what he does in real life. He talks people into forming their own opinions. His agenda was not to turn a buch of 10 year olds into chain smokers but just to give them an idea of what it is to be like him in real life. Which was the whole point of that meeting. But words do have a power. Once a rebellious seed is planted it is hard to quell the surge of ideas that follow. I concede that Nick's behaviour was irresponsible and cocky but I'm not yet ready to believe that he was a hypocrite.
