    	<h1 class="center">Consumer ethics in Thank you for smoking</h1>
        <p>Recently I came upon this paper ,by Stacy Thompson, called 
	  <a href="http://www.film-philosophy.com/2009v13n1/thompson.pdf">Consumer ethics in thank you for smoking</a>. 
	  The subject matter of this piece is  Nick Naylor, the protagonist in
	  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/">Thank you for smoking </a> and the goal is to find out whether 
	  Nick acted ethically or not. To determine that, Nick's actions are judged against moral guidelines laid down by great philosophers such as Aristotle and Kierkegaard. The paper itself is very well written and if you haven't already you should read it. But there were a few things I found a bit off and so I decided to an
	  analysis myself, taking Stacy's work as the base. 
	<p>
	  Stacy's analysis begins with Nick's response "If he wants to smoke . . . Iâ€™ll buy him his first pack" to senator Finistree's question "When  your  son  turns  18,  will  you  let  him  smoke  if  he wants  to?" The author claims that Nick's response was a bluff. That his son's freedom is seemingly preserved only after he can withstand years of his father's badgering. In other words what he's saying is that Nick's son never really had a choice.</p>
<p>During the same scene ,that the author is talking about, Nick maintained that it is the duty of every parent to educate their children about perlis of smoking. Pasting a skull and bones label on a ciggarette packet is not going to help any one. He goes on to argue that if the committe thinks that ciggarette smoking is evil for causing deaths why not go ahead and put a skull and bones label on cars which cause great number of deaths due to accidents. Or even on cheese packaging which cause death due to high cholsetrol levels, choking the arteries. 
</p>
<p>Second Nick advocated a healthy skepticism even among children who were not yet developed in their critical reasoning abilities. During his presentation in Joey's school Nick more or less asked the children to not trust thier parents on the perlis of smoking and they that should try themselves to find out if smoking does indeed kill. He compares smoking to a harmless exercise like eating chocolates. Would you stop eating chocolates just because someone told you so?</p>
 
<p>These two statements by Nick are contradictory to one another. On one hand he wants to inclulcate a feeling of independant thinking in children by asking them to not take anybody's word at face value and form their own opnions. On the other hand Nick wants the parents to educate thier children about perils of smoking, making their job difficult as a bunch of strong headed "independant thinking" children are hard to reason with and not everyone posesses Nick's gift with the words. Even if they do it's not like teenagers are going to listen to them. Was Nick a hypocrite?</p>
<p>
Maybe. What we need to keep in mind that during his presentation at the school Nick objective was to to tell the students what he does for a living. Nick makes a living by talking. What he did at the school was a demonstration of what he does in real life. He talks people into forming their own opinions. His agenda was not to turn a buch of 10 year olds into chain smokers but just to give them an idea of what it is to be like him in real life. Which was the whole point of that meeting. But words do have a power. Once a rebellious seed is planted it is hard to quell the surge of ideas that follow. I concede that Nick's behaviour was irresponsible and cocky but I'm not yet ready to believe that he was a hypocrite.  
</p>

<p>Coming back to Stacy's paper he argues that what Nick promotes is not virtuous according to Aristotle's ethics because smoking is an excess and already away from the temperate mean. The reasoning being just like there can't be right amount of adultery any amount is already an excess so too there can't be a right amount of smoking. I must admit that the argument is pretty convincing but I feel that it is incomplete. I don't think it's fair to judge a person just on one aspect of ethics and ignore everything else. Granted that the temperate mean is the decidicing factor in all of Aristotle's virtues but if you are going to evaluate a person then either evaluate him against all the virtues or none at all. Apparently Nick fails at controlling his bodily pleasures but what about other morals. How does he do at them? Let's see:- </p>
<p><strong>Bravery: The mean between rashness and cowardice</strong></p>
<p>Nick shows many signs of bravery throughtout the movie. Going to the live TV show to speak for the tobacco organization in the presence of a cancer inflicted teenager,clerly knowing that he was hated by one and all. Going to malboro man's house and offering him money even though he had a gun pointed to his head. And ultimately facing senetor Finistree in a committee hearing when he was fired from his company and had absolutely no reason to be there except for his beliefs.</p>
<p>Nick stood for the freedom of choice. He believed in it and was willing to be demolished in public for his beliefes. Initially it may be argued that he was doing it just for the sake of his job. But it became clear towards the end that his guiding light was joey,his son. To whom he was a hero. Someone who has a point of view, however unpopular, and who is not unwilling to stand by it in the time of difficulty. Nick was afraid of diappointing his son but he was not perturbed of being ridiuled and even have his reputation destroyed publically if it meant he became the ideal that Joey imagined him to be. His actions were consistent throughout. He stuck to his guns. +1 to Nick</p>

	<p><strong>Temprence - mean with regard to bodily pleasures</strong></p>
	<p>Nick enjoyed good food. Had good taste in movies. 
	  Indulged in wine and company of women. Wore good clothes. 
	  He knew how to take care of himself. On the other hand he was addicted to smokeing and grew restless when 
	  he was out of ciggarettes. 0</p>

	<p>[<em>The movie does not give us a chance to evaluate Nick on the virtues of 
	    generosity,munificence and magnanimity. So we'll skip these.</em>]</p>

	<p><strong>Honor:The right ambition</strong></p>
	<p>Nick worked for a tobaco firm. 
	  He had a boss just like everyone else. 
	  But he displayed signs of ambition by trying to impress the last great man of tobaco. 
	  One of the founding fathers of his firm.  He wanted to rise up to the big league. +1
	</p>
	<p><strong>Good temper: Mean with respect to anger</strong></p>
        <p>Nick displayed good temper throughout the movie. He was often cast into heated debates but he never lost his composure and always argued with reason. He also displayed annoyance when his boss tried to steal his ideas and sell them as his own to the Captain. +1</p>
	<p><strong>Friendliness</strong></p>
	<p>Nick was a friendly person. He had no trouble forming a connection with people whom he barely knew. It took 2 minutes for him to start laughing and smiling with Heather. Captain started liking Nick 2 seconds after started they talking.  he had no trouble striking up conversations with people on a plane. Even though the nature of his job put him in many controversial situations he managed to put up with it and retain his ability to connect with people. </p>
	<p>He had few friends just 2 but he was close with them and they cared for each other. +1</p>
<p>The nature of Nick's </p>
<p><strong>Truthfullness</strong></p>
	<p>Nick's job as he said himself required a bit of moral felixibilty. He knew how to bend the facts and often boasted and exxagerated the facts to get what he wanted. -1 </p>
	<p><strong>Wit</strong></p>
	<p>Knew how to speak and speak well. Always spoke the right amount of words. No more, no less. Was never caught off guard even during the most difficult of situations. Used humor and sarcasm effectively to dodge hard questions and managed to keep his cool about him at all times. +1 </p>
	<p><strong>Justice</strong></p>
	<p>Nick often bent the rules to suit his purpose. He only cared about achieving his goals at all costs. Justice was not one of his virtues. -1</p>
	<p>On the Aristotles scale Nick scores 4 out of 8 virtues we could evaluate. Just like most people he had flaws. But dismissing all of his actions as amoral is not right. While his promotion of free will in chosing to smoke might gain a point in aristotle's bravery scale it looses a point in the temerance scale. While his banter and wit may give him points in friendliness and witiiness he looses points in justice and truthfullness. So aristotle ethics is not really a good measure to determine Nick's action as moral or amoral.
