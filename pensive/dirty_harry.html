	  Harry Callahan is a man of few words. He is not the type of person who shows
	  his emotions easily. I think it helps him do his job well. When you
	  are chasing criminals day in and day out it's important that you have a certain
	  hardened look about you. But  when he is not performing his duty Harry is a very
	  understanding and caring sort of a fellow.
	  Most people never get to see that side of Harry's personality.
	  Which is a tragedy if you ask me. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  As the self appointed PR manager for Harry I feel that it is
	  my duty to show to you his sensitive side. To speak the words that were never said. 
	  Below is a quote from  an eyewitness who recounted Harry's conversation with a bank robber. 
	</p>
       <p> <strong>What Harry said</strong></p>
	<p>
	  <blockquote>
	    I know what you're thinking.
	    "Did he fire six shots or only five?"
	    Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I kinda lost track myself.
	    But being this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world
	    and would blow your head clean off,
	    you've gotta ask yourself one question:
	    "Do I feel lucky?" Well, do ya, punk?
	  </blockquote>
	</p>
        <p><strong>What Harry meant</strong></p>
        <p>
	  I have an idea of what you might be deliberating about.
	  You are probably wondering if I discharged six bullets or five.
	  If I may be entirely honest with you, I seem to have lost count myself in all of this commotion.
	  You see when a fellow fires one round and everybody starts howling an running like
	  baboons it becomes a bit hard to concentrate. I hope you understand my situation.
	  I would have helped you if I could. Nevertheless I would like to impress upon
	  you the fact that I am holding in my hand a .44 calibre magnum.
	  The brainy lads in the ballistics department have bestowed upon this
	  magnificent firearm the honor of being the most powerful handgun in the world.
	  Now I think you will agree with me that if I took a shot at your face we can
	  be somewhat certain of the scenario where it would explode like a balloon.
	  I'm afraid,old pal, that at this time all the odds are stacked against you. 
	  Allow me to give some advice as one friend to another. Before you make
	  any move please conduct an introspection to
	  determine whether you consider yourself lucky or not?  
	</p>

	  Even to an enemy Harry was very polite and reasonable. He sought to avoid conflict as far as possible.
	  While it's true that he was rather curt but that doesn't mean that he had no sympathy in his heart. 
	  I suppose it is easy to dismiss people like Harry as insensitive. Doesn't mean it's true.
	  Harry might look like an uncaring man but at his core he was as innocent as a lamb.
	  Wouldn't this world be a better place if each one of us tried to look for the best in people.
	  Ah yes. That would be wonderful indeed.
