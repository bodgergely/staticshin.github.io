        <h1 class="center">Global Micro Transactions</h1>
	<!-- It's usually a much better idea to invest in the currency of the area you live in as you will be spending your money in this currency. -->
        <p>International payments are not optimized for micro transactions.  A foreign withdrawal from an ATM may be charged up-to 5%. Wire transfers from banks deduct an arbitrary  fee sometimes both from the sender and the receiver. Banks are often not upfront about the currency exchange rates and swallow money in between a transaction without any indication to the customer. </p>
<p>When we are dealing with international payments there are a lot of moving parts. SWIFT/IBAN wire transfers are not always direct i.e from the sender to the receiver and there may be quite a few intermediary banks involved before the funds reach their destination. There is no way to tell what banks take what amount from the wire. For large payments these costs may not be too significant but if you are looking to transfer say less than EUR 1000, internationally, then small cuts matter.</p>
	<p>Single currency across all the banks seems like an attractive solution. With a digital currency like bitcoin these extra costs can be avoided completely. Similarly if you happen to live in a EU region any transfer within EUR has negligible costs associated with it. </p>
	<p>But since bitcoin has not gained widespread acceptance and low cost EUR transfers are limited to ,well, the EU region (in essence creating a localized "banking zone") the fact remains that there has been no solution that facilitates micro payments on a global level.</p>

	<p><em>"Why does one even need globalized micro payments?"</em></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Tourism industry is at an all time high. The wanderlust has never been stronger among the people. They want to experience different cultures, exotic foods and sights of foreign lands but usually end up paying more than their fair share of hidden costs.</li>

	  <li>Increasingly a large number of people establishing businesses offshore, while still looking to retain local talent, are left only with two choices. Either take the transfer costs in their stride or deal with the inconvenience of handling two bank accounts -- an offshore account for your offshore business and a local account to pay your employees.</li>
	  
	</ul>
	<p>A lot has been written about using blockchain to settle payments in real time. It's admirable that banks have started to recognize the importance of cutting edge technology as a form of future investment but the problem of high cost of fx can be solved much more easily using the tools that are available right now. To wit offshore multicurrency light debit accounts. </p>

	<p><em>"I say what now?"</em></p>
	<p>Offshore multi currency light debit accounts.</p>
	<p><em>"What does that mean?"</em></p>
	<p>Well look at it this way. </p>
	<p>We are living in an increasingly interconnected world ,trading internationally in a largely digital space. What if instead of trying to get everyone to agree on a single currency (like bitcoin) or trying create a single localized banking zone everywhere like (EU) or trying to invest in a new infrastructure altogether like (blockchain), we try something simpler. Like give the customers an ability to:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Open an international bank account easily using a rented postal address</li>
	  <li>Let them accept multiple currencies in their account.</li>
	  <li>And have them withdraw the money in their local currency using a debit card.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><em>"That's impossible!"</em></p>
	<p>Not quite. A rented postal address is cheap. Once the identity proof is acquired a light account can be created that allows the user to accept payments and either transfer money to their local account or withdraw it using their debit card. Transfers within the same network of accounts would be free and fast. There won't be any fx costs associated. </p>
	<p>The solution is not entirely novel. Travellers have been doing this for ages by walking up to a bank branch and opening up an account with them. And then transferring their local currency to the foreign account so that they can spend the money locally without having to endure the exorbitant fees from the banks or the atms.The question is how do we scale this? </p>
	<p>It's not that hard. We can take inspiration from the people who help in offshore registration of companies. The entire process is completed within 1 business day. All you have to do is submit an online request and send in your scanned identity proof along with it. The documents are verified manually and if all goes well you have a company registered along with a rented postal address.</p> 
<p>It will be quite easy and cost effective to partner with a business that offers mailbox for rent. And given that on boarding a customer is a low maintenance process (one time only) it wouldn't be hard to increase the operational capacity by outsourcing the work to people who are already efficient in doing these things. To cover the cost of operations the user can be charged a small "rental" to manage their accounts.</p>


<p>It's important to note that we're not proposing to open up a savings account but rather we're implementing a physical manifestation of digital wallets. A "holding account" of sorts where your funds stay as long as you don't transfer or withdraw them. Taking the best parts of what make digital wallets so popular in the first place and putting them inside a bank account.</p>

<p>Such an account solves many problems at once. First it gives the customers an ability to have funds in multiple currencies. It allows them to withdraw the funds from their local atm machines at the ordinary transaction costs and no losses in currency transfer. Finally it allows unrestricted movement of funds within the internal network of accounts. </p>

<p>On the last point consider a scenario where an offshore company has opened up multicurrency holding account for itself and it's employees in a bank. At the end of each month they move funds from their account (and in their operating currency) to the accounts of their employees (in their local currency). The employees can then choose to either transfer the amount to their savings bank or withdraw the money from their debit cards.</p>

	<p>A tremendous opportunity awaits a bank which can recognize this need for multicurrency "light debit accounts". Muti currency accounts have been here for a while. But they haven't gained much popularity because of high costs of operation and difficulty of  opening one in your name. Most of these challenges can be overcome by simply changing the internal policy of banks. Give the user an easy way to open an offshore account,allow them to hold multiple currencies at once,lower the costs of annual maintenance of such accounts and there you go! Now you have a low tech, regulated and immediately implementable solution to the movement of micro international funds.</p>
