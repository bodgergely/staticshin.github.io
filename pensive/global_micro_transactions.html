        <h1 class="center">Global Micro Transactions</h1>
	<!-- It's usually a much better idea to invest in the currency of the area you live in as you will be spending your money in this currency. -->
        <p>Global payments are not optimized for micro transactions. Wire tranfers arguably the cheapest method apply aribitrary service charge. You may be charged upto 5% for each foreign withdrawl from an ATM.  </p>
	<p>Single currency across all the banks seems an attractive solution. With a digital currency like bitcoin these extra costs can be avoided completely. Simillarly if you happen to live in a EU region any transferr in EUR has negligible costs associated with it. </p>
	<p>But since bitcoin has not gained widespread acceptance and EUR transfers are limited to ,well, the EU region (in essence creating a localized "banking zone") the fact remains that there has been no solution that facilitates micropayments on a global level. </p>

	<p><em>"Why does one even need globalized micro payments?"</em></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Tourism industry is at an all time high. The wanderlust has never been stronger among the people. They want to expereince different cultures, exotic foods and sights of foreign lands but usually end up paying more than their fair share of hidden costs.</li>

	  <li>Increasingly a large number of people establishing businesses offshore, while still looking to retain local talent, are left only with two choices. Either take the transfer costs in thier stride or deal with the inconvinence of handling two bank accounts -- an offshore account for your offshore business and a local account to pay your employess.</li>
	  
	  <li> </li>
	</ul>
	<p>A lot has been written about using blockchain to settle payments in real time. It's admirable that banks have started to recognize the importance of cutting edge technology as a form of future investment but the problem of high cost of fx can be solved much more eaisily using the tools that are  much eaiser to implement and avialable right now. To wit offshore multicurrency light debit accounts </p>

	<p><em>"I say what now?"</em></p>
	<p>Offshore multi currency light debit accounts</p>
	<p><em>"What does that mean?"</em></p>
	<p>Well look at it this way. </p>
	<p>We are living in an increasingly interconnected world ,trading internationally in a largely digital space. What if insetead of trying to get everyone to agree on a single currency (like bitcoin) or trying create a single localized banking zone everywhere like (EU) or trying to invest in a new infrastrucure altogether like (blockchain), we try something simple. Like give the customers an ability to:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Open an international bank account easily using a rented postal address</li>
	  <li>Accept multiple currencies in their account.</li>
	  <li>And have them withdraw the money in tiehr local currency using a debit card.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><em>"That's impossible!"</em></p>
	<p>Not quite. A rented postal address is cheap. Once the identy proof is acquired a light account can be created that allows the user to accept payments and either transfer money to their local account or withdraw it using thier debit card. Transfers within the same netwrok of accounts would be free and fast. There won't be any fx costs associated. </p>
<p>It's important to note that it's not a proposal to open up a savings account rather think of it as a phycial manifestation of digital wallets. </p>
	<p>A tremendous opportunity awaits a bank which can recongize this need for multicurrency "light debit accounts". Muti currency accounts have been there for a while. But they haven't gained much popularity because of high costs of operation and difficulty in opening one in your name.</p>
