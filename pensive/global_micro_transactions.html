        <h1 class="center">Global Micro Transactions</h1>
	<!-- It's usually a much better idea to invest in the currency of the area you live in as you will be spending your money in this currency. -->
        <p>Internatonal payments are not optimized for micro transactions.  A foreign withdrawl from an ATM may be charged upto 5%. Wire tranfers from banks apply an aribitrary service charge somtimes both to the sender and the reciever . Banks are often not upfront about the currency exchange rates and swallow certain portions of transactions without any indication to the customer.  </p>
	<p>Single currency across all the banks seems an attractive solution. With a digital currency like bitcoin these extra costs can be avoided completely. Simillarly if you happen to live in a EU region any transferr in EUR has negligible costs associated with it. </p>
	<p>But since bitcoin has not gained widespread acceptance and EUR transfers are limited to ,well, the EU region (in essence creating a localized "banking zone") the fact remains that there has been no solution that facilitates micropayments on a global level. </p>

	<p><em>"Why does one even need globalized micro payments?"</em></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Tourism industry is at an all time high. The wanderlust has never been stronger among the people. They want to expereince different cultures, exotic foods and sights of foreign lands but usually end up paying more than their fair share of hidden costs.</li>

	  <li>Increasingly a large number of people establishing businesses offshore, while still looking to retain local talent, are left only with two choices. Either take the transfer costs in thier stride or deal with the inconvinence of handling two bank accounts -- an offshore account for your offshore business and a local account to pay your employess.</li>
	  
	  <li> </li>
	</ul>
	<p>A lot has been written about using blockchain to settle payments in real time. It's admirable that banks have started to recognize the importance of cutting edge technology as a form of future investment but the problem of high cost of fx can be solved much more eaisily using the tools that are  much eaiser to implement and avialable right now. To wit offshore multicurrency light debit accounts </p>

	<p><em>"I say what now?"</em></p>
	<p>Offshore multi currency light debit accounts</p>
	<p><em>"What does that mean?"</em></p>
	<p>Well look at it this way. </p>
	<p>We are living in an increasingly interconnected world ,trading internationally in a largely digital space. What if insetead of trying to get everyone to agree on a single currency (like bitcoin) or trying create a single localized banking zone everywhere like (EU) or trying to invest in a new infrastrucure altogether like (blockchain), we try something simple. Like give the customers an ability to:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Open an international bank account easily using a rented postal address</li>
	  <li>Accept multiple currencies in their account.</li>
	  <li>And have them withdraw the money in their local currency using a debit card.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><em>"That's impossible!"</em></p>
	<p>Not quite. A rented postal address is cheap. Once the identy proof is acquired a light account can be created that allows the user to accept payments and either transfer money to their local account or withdraw it using thier debit card. Transfers within the same network of accounts would be free and fast. There won't be any fx costs associated. </p>
<p>The sloution is not entirely novel. Travellers have been doing this for ages by walking up to a bank branch and opening up an account with them. And then transferring thier local currency to the foreign account so that they can spend the money thier without having to endure the exorbitant fees from the banks or the atms.The question is how do we scale this </p>

<p>It's important to note that we're not proposing to open up a savings account but rather we're implementing a phycial manifestation of digital wallets. A "holding account" of sorts where your funds stay as long as you don't transfer or withdraw them. Taking the best parts of what make digital wallets so popular in the first place and putting them inside a bank account.</p>

<p>Such an account solves many problems at once. First it gives the customers an ability to have funds in multiple currencies. It allows them to withraw the funds from their local atm machines at the ordinary transaction costs and no losses in currency transfer. Finally it allows unresitricted movement of funds within the internal network of accounts. </p>

<p>On the last point consider a scenario where an offshore company has opened up multicurrency holding account for itself and it's employees in a bank. At the end of each month they move funds from thier account and in thier operating currency to the accounts of their employees in thier local currency. The employees can then choose to either transfer the amount to their savings bank or withdraw the money from their debit cards.</p>

	<p>A tremendous opportunity awaits a bank which can recongize this need for multicurrency "light debit accounts". Muti currency accounts have been there for a while. But they haven't gained much popularity because of high costs of operation and difficulty of  opening one in your name. Most of these challanges can be overcome by simply changing the internal policy of banks. Give the user an easy way to open an offshore account,allow them to hold multiple currencies at once,lower the costs of annual maintence of such accounts and there you go! Now you have a low tech, regulated and immediately implementable solution to the movement of international funds.</p>
