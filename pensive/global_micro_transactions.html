        <h1 class="center">Global Micro Transactions</h1>
<!-- It's usually a much better idea to invest in the currency of the area you live in as you will be spending your money in this currency. -->
        <p>Global payments are not optimized for micro transactions. Wire tranfers arguably the cheapest method apply aribitrary service charge. You may be charged upto 5% for each foreign withdrawl from an atm.  </p>
	<p>Single currency across all the banks seems an attractive solution. With a digital currency like bitcoin these extra costs can be avoided completely. Simillarly if you happen to live in a EU region any transferr in EUR has negligible costs associated with it. </p>
	<p>But since bitcoin has not gained widespread acceptance and EUR transfers are limited to ,well, the EU region (in essence creating a localized "banking zone") the fact remains that there has been no solution that facilitates micropayments on a global level. </p>

	<p><em>"Why does one even need globalized micro payments?"</em></p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Tourism industry is at an all time high. The wanderlust has never been stronger among the people. They want to expereince different cultures, exotic foods and sights of foreign lands but usually end up paying more than their fair share of hidden costs.</li>

	  <li>Increasingly a large number of people are establishing businesses offshore while still looking to retain local talent are left only with two choices     </li>
