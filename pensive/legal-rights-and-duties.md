###Notes on Legal rights and duties

The author starts by discussing the nature of human intercourse through the
civilization. People have always maintained the concept of "right and wrong".
What a person ought to do. And what a person should refrain from doing. That much is clear. 

Since we have always held the notion of right, it becomes difficult to explain what a right
actually is from the perspective of the legal science. The ambiguity of a language presents
an obstacle to our understanding the term right as a concept of law.

Is right something which is morally accepted by the society as the correct thing to do? Or
is it something that a person ought or ought not to do regardless of the view of the society?
How does law protect a right? Does free will have any effect on right?  What are duties? Does
free will have an effect on the duty of a person?

An analytic discussion of the word right raises many questions and there are an equal number of
answers depending upon the point of view with one chooses to analyze.

A society has a force of opinion that is is greater than the opinion of any single person. This
opinion influences the behaviour of all the individuals within it. The actions which confirm to
the opinion of the society are praised where as those which contradict are censured.

But a society is not a nation. The opinion of the neighbours may/may-not approve
the actions of a person but that opinion can't be used as a test for their validity. Since
what is right has to be good for the greatest number of people. And what is wrong has to be
bad for the greatest number of people.

"A right is co-relative to duty. Where there is no duty there is no right. 
But there can be duties without a right." What follows is that duty creates rights.
In order for a duty to create right there must be an action or it's forbearance.

Since a right is an action or it's forbearance the exercise of right is determined by the will of the individual.
The wills of the greater portion of men is exercised by a fictitious person called state.
Where as an individual right must be exercised by an individual.

For example: I have the right to live peacefully in my house. If a person through his actions
obstructs my right of enjoyment I can compel or forbear him to remove the obstruction. But the
act of compulsion or forbearance must come through me, my will. I can also choose to look the
other way. I can choose not to exercise my right.

But if a man murders another then it is not up to the relatives of the murdered man
to determine whether the murderer should be brought to justice. In this case the the right
to life was taken from a murdered man and the fictitious person
called state chooses to exercise the rights on the
behalf of the murdered man.

The above example also gives some insight into what duties are.
In the first example it is the duty of every
man to not obstruct the peaceful living or a person in his house.
This duty creates a right by giving the
person power to compel him to stop an act of obstruction.
If the peaceful living is obstructed then the person can choose to remove that obstruction. 

In the second case it is the duty of the fictitious person state to protect the right to life of a
citizen. It does not give any right to state to choose whether or not to punish a man who takes away the right
to life. If the right is taken away the murderer is brought to justice regardless of
the will of the state or the relatives.

Legal duties are different from moral duties.
It is a moral duty of a man to love his neighbour.
But I can't be punished for not loving mine.
But I can be punished for not paying the fine which the judgment in a court has
imposed on me. 

Legal duties are therefore not a subject of will.
Whether I will it or I will it not any legal duty imposed on me
must be performed. 

Following the discussion above it is quite clear why animals have no rights in most law.
Because animals can not perform a duty. If right is correlative to a duty and
every being having exercising a right must also perform a duty then if animals are given
the power to exercise a right then they must be competent to perform the duty.

But this raises lot's of question in itself. Given that animals are incompetent
to perform any duty and therefor unable to have any rights, what then about
the newly born or the mentally sick person. They are incapable of performing their
duty as well. Do they also not have any rights?

This is a very thought provoking question and was discussed by Gray in the chapter called
legal persons where he discusses who are the subjects of law and what are the fictions in law?
