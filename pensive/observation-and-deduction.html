        <p>
	  Sherlock Holmes reasoned about his cases in two distinct phases.
	  In the observational phase he'd go about collecting facts, looking for clues and carefully gathering
	  information from as many sources as necessary. During this period he'd try not to form any
	  concrete opinion about the solution to the problem he was trying to solve. Many times Watson
	  would ask Holmes the meaning of their latest discovery but Holmes would rarely throw any light on
	  the matter. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  The other phase which he called deduction invovlved an ellimination of possibilites
	  that couldnt' happen untill only one remained, however improbable, that explained the facts.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Of course obtaining facts by itself is not of much use unless one has way to extract useful information
	  from them. Holmes overcame this by a meticulous study on a wide variety of subjects. He had deep
	  knowledge of chemistry, poisons, handwriting, geography soil composition, knew obsucre languages and
	  in short there was hardly a subject where holmes would find himself out of his depth. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  Therefore by combining his acute observational power,
	  his deep knowledge on a wide variety of subjects he'd be able to not only
	  find meaning in cryptic things but also be able to
	</p>
        <p>
	  House on the other hand, once he got all the information he needed, he'd start arranging
	  it ,piece by piece, in a way that would form a complete picutre of the
	  events surrounding the mystery.
