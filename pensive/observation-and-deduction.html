	<!-- give concrete examples in the paragraph below -->
	<p>	  
	  How simple it all sounds when Sherlock does it. From the shake of a hand he's able to
	  deduce that the person has been to Afganistan. From a glance of the boots he's able to
	  conclude the occupation of a man. From the sound of the steps he's able to tell who is
	  at the doorstep. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  His methods and tricks seem so natural that one often forgets that he was just fiction and tires to emulate him
	  in real life. No doubt once or twice you've walked up to a friend and remarked about how his sleeve had a stain on the
	  left corner and then went on to ask . Also no doubt your friend is generally not pleased to see you in Holmes' character
	  as to try to look at your "observing and deducing" best while smoking an imaginary pipe.
	</p>
	<p>
	  But we should not let small stumbles get in the way of our understanding the methods of Sherlock Holmes.
	  We all owe it to our friends. They were very patient with us while we made a fool of ourselves.
	  We can't give up when the things get tough. It would be an insult to freindship.</p>
	<p>
	  Imaginary as he no doubt was
	  Sherlock still got his logic right.
	  His ability to think critically and his expertise in focusing on the most important details
	  won him followeres and acclaim. The bar he has set for us is very high. We are not aiming to
	  become like him.
	  All we are trying to understand is how he did what he did. All we want to do is
	  to know how tall the mountain really is?

	  <h3>Sherlock's method</h3>
	</p>
        <p>
	  Sherlock Holmes reasoned about his cases in two distinct phases.
	  In the observational phase he'd go about collecting facts, looking for clues and carefully gathering
	  information from as many sources as necessary. During this period he'd try not to form any
	  concrete opinion about the solution to the problem he was trying to solve. Many times Watson
	  would ask Holmes the meaning of their latest discovery but Holmes would rarely throw any light on
	  the matter. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  The other phase which he called deduction invovlved an ellimination of possibilites
	  that couldnt' happen untill only one remained, however improbable, that explained the facts.
	</p>
        <p>
	  Of course obtaining facts by itself is not of much use unless one has way to extract useful information
	  from them. Holmes overcame this by a meticulous study on a wide variety of subjects. He had deep
	  knowledge of chemistry, poisons, handwriting, geography soil composition, knew obsucre languages and
	  in short there was hardly a subject where holmes would find himself out of his depth. 
	</p>
        <p>
	  Therefore by combining his acute observational power,
	  his deep knowledge on a wide variety of subjects he'd be able to not only
	  find meaning in cryptic things but also be able to
	</p>
        <p>
	  House on the other hand, once he got all the information he needed, he'd start arranging
	  it ,piece by piece, in a way that would form a complete picutre of the
	  events surrounding the mystery.
