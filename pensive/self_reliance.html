    	<h1 class="center">Self Reliance</h1>
        <p>Generally a reading of philosophy is very abstract. You've got a bunch of people talking about virtues and vices and right and wrong as if they were things to talk about. They aren't of course. A virtue like courage for example means nothing if it's not represented in a person. A person can think courageously. A person can act courageously. But a person can't talk about courage like he talks about say eating a banana.  .In the end courage is the property of an actor. When you read a story that describes the valor of a David against a Golaith it  teaches you something about what courage actually means. But when we have Socrates chirping about bravery,justice and what not without telling us how the hero killed the princess and resuced the dragon our brain shuts down. We don't understand anything. There is no takeaway.This "in my opinion" is the problem with philosophy. It focuses too much definitions and too little on application. I mean just take Aristotle for example. Guy spends a great deal of time talking about ethics and politics and peotry and <strong>comes</strong> off as a very wise fellow. Which I have no doubt that he was. But then look at his star student Alexander who marches on ahead calling himself a God destroying citites and butchering people to staisfy his lust for power. All this while our master doubles down on his efforts and produces book after book on every subject imaginmable : rhetoric, metaphycis and this and that. Does all of this not seem a little odd?</p>
        <p>I say this not to critque Socrates or Airstotle. There is no doubt that the western Philosophy is shaped by them but to be frank I don't really get what they are teaching. And although everytime I hear the phrase "Socratic questioning" I take my frustration out on a juicy apple it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the significace of great thoughts of these great men. I read their books but then I put them away in a corner. I say all this only to provide a background as to my state of mind when I came upon an essay, by the great American scholar Raplh Waldo Emerson, titled Self Reliance.</p>
        <p>Now before we begin talking about Self Reliance let me make a few more admissions. I had never before read Emerson. I was aware of this cult of "Transcendentalists" but it appeared to me that these folks were into some kind vodoo majic hippie healing power of nature and therfore being a man of a little (too little some would say) sicentific bent of mind I kept away from him. In the first few lines Self Reliance does infact seem like ramblings of some old man who has just lost it. Phrases like "nourishing corn", "gleam of light" and "latent conviction" did not make a favorable first impression on me and I almost gave up on the essay. Emerson's writing is poetic and vivid almost like a painting. But it's also hard to understand. It needs to be absorbed slowly. The essay demands patience.  </p>
        <p></p>
       <p><em>"A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us"</em></p>
        <p>They say that to truly understand the words in a book one must have a certain amount of life expereince. The emotions that words inflame must already be simmering somewhere deep inside of us. Self reliance is one of those rare essays on philosophy that speak directly to the heart. How often we've heard the varition of "Trust Thyself" from firends, TV shows, in music and even in relgion. Infact so often this phrase has been flashed across us that it has stopped to mean much except a feel good . </p>
        <p>I mean to say it's as if he was deliberately trying to not win friends and influence people! How come? </p>
        <p>Self reliance is not an easy read. You go flip the pages, you burn and only then you understand. But as emerson put it in his words, trust thyself. </p>
