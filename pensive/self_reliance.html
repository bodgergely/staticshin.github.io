    	<h1 class="center">Self Reliance</h1>
        <p>Generally a reading of philosophy is very abstract. You've got a bunch of people talking about virtues and vices and right and wrong as if they were things to talk about. They aren't of course. A virtue like courage for example means nothing if it's not represented in a person. A person can think courageously. A person can act courageously. But a person can't talk about courage like he talks about,say, eating a banana. In the end courage is the property of an actor. Like banana pulp is the property of a banana. You can't talk about banana pulp without talking about banana. Simillarly you can't talk about courage without talking about the person who posses that courage. We can easily say that Joan of Arc was brave. But we can't talk much about bravery any more than we can talk about banana pulp. When you read a story that describes the valor of a David against a Golaith it teaches you something about what courage actually means. But when we have Socrates chirping about bravery,justice and what not without telling us how the hero killed the princess and resuced the dragon our brain shuts down. We don't understand anything. There is no takeaway.This is the problem with philosophy. It focuses too much definitions and too little on application. I mean just take Aristotle for example. Guy spends a great deal of time talking about ethics and politics and peotry and <strong>comes</strong> off as a very wise fellow. Which I have no doubt that he was. But then look at his star student Alexander who marches on ahead calling himself a God destroying citites and butchering people to staisfy his lust for power. All this while our master doubles down on his efforts and produces book after book on every subject imaginmable : rhetoric, metaphycis and this and that. Does all of this not seem a little odd?</p>
        <p>I say this not to critque Socrates or Airstotle. There is no doubt that the western Philosophy is shaped by them but to be frank I don't really get what they are teaching. And although everytime I hear the phrase "Socratic questioning" I take my frustration out on a juicy apple it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the significace of great thoughts of these great men. I read their books but then I put them away in a corner. I say all this only to provide a background as to my state of mind when I came upon an essay, by the great American scholar Raplh Waldo Emerson, titled Self Reliance.</p>
        <p>Now before we begin talking about Self Reliance let me make a few more admissions. I had never read Emerson  before. I was aware of this cult of "Transcendentalists" but I suspected that these folks were into some kind vodoo majic hippie healing power of nature and therfore being a man of a little (too little some would say) sicentific <strong>bent</strong> of mind I kept away from him. In the first few lines Self Reliance does infact seem like ramblings of some old man who has just lost it. Phrases like "nourishing corn", "gleam of light" and "latent conviction" did not make a favorable first impression on me and I almost gave up on the essay. Emerson's writing is poetic and vivid. But it's also hard to understand. It needs to be absorbed slowly. The essay demands patience but the fruit it offers really is sweet.</p>
        <p>A large part of self reliance is about protecting one's individuality. It becomes clear from the first sentence that Emerson is a great admirer of orignal thinking and the emotion that such a thinking conveys regardless of the merit of the thought. Genius ,as he says, is belief in your own thought whitout any regard to stregth of force opposed to that idea. In both actual and intellectual life all that should matter is what you must do. What people think should be of little concern. </p>
        <p>Confirmty is a draining force in life. Not only it robs you of your vitality but it also compells you to walk on a false path, one that is not true to your character. Every word that we utter must take into account the sentiments of the party to which we have commited ourselves to. We must learn to bow to names and badges. We must learn to accept the customs and traditons. We must learn to subdue and subjgate our own inner voice so that we may become a noise in the chorus. </p>
	<p>Virtues are particesd as penances. Life is lived as an aplogy, a spectacle. We run from ourselves, we seek affirmation in others and we are afraid of everything that is new and spontaneous. A stoic detachment is essential for a true life. We must learn to scorn appearances. We must not seek to please. It is important to understand that the force of character is cumulative and by practice of self relinace new powers will appear that shall restore life. </p>

        <p>A man is better than a town. The thoughts and ideas that come to us in silence are sacred and must be treasured. One must learn to keep the sweet independance of solitude in the midst of a crowd. Babes, children and brutes understand very well the importance of self. They are unquored and whole. Their thoughts and theirs actions are pure. They care not for any consequence and freely judge what crosses their paths to the best of their ability. They can't be overpowered. They refuse to bow or show deference to any authority. Such nonchalance is a healthy attitude of man. We must learn to obey our inner voice. </p>
        <p> While on one side self reliance is freedom from all outside influence on the other hand it's a total surrender and an absolute obedience to the soul. The things we observe, the company of people we find ourselves in, and the connection of events are not chance happenings. We must not rove or complain or struggle with the external events but instead be still and accept the law of divine providence.</p>
        <p>We must learn to live in the present and do right now. All our actions however insoncistant they may appear will be found harmonious in the end. We can not pre justify all our acts. We must not be a prisoner of our past. Sticking to consistancy is foul. Virtue and vice are not just represented in our overt actions but betray us in every breath we take. We are our character. We can't fight it.</p>
        <p>Intuition is our guide. We must not seek to explain our actions. There is no need to show cause for our whims. We owe, to our involuantary acts, a perfect, unquestioning faith. Honest actions are the prayers of a simple and clear mind. Like the voyage of a ship, a zigzag line of tacks, when seen from a distance appears straight. Perception is strong, sight is weak. </p>
        <p> Our confirmity and distrust of private sentiment explains nothing. The actions that appeal to popular opnion  are not our own and neither is our path. But we end up going where some one else takes us. We look at "our leaders" and take their word as gospel. We do not understand that they can't say one orginal and spontaenous word. Their acts are all predictable. Sponataniety is always private. It can't be a group activity. The law of orignial action by a private man is greater than the law of any commitee. It's only when a person stands alone that he can be said to be strong and have a chance to prevail.</p>
        <p>We read the books of great men. We learn their sayings but we can't understand their meaning. We can't grasp that books are but a means to an end. If what the books speak of is true we shall discover the same truth on our own when the time comes. We should not put much weight of a few verses. A few lines of text should not usrup what we believe to be true in our heart. The integreity of mind is sacred. Our soul has the absolution that we seek. If we are the devil's then we must live by the devil's way. </p>
        <p>The consequece of non confirmity is displeasure of the world. When you march to your own beat you can be sure to be greeted by sour faces. Resistance is to be expected. But this displeasure has no deep cause. The feelings of the masses, their goodwill and their resentment are shallow and something that must be treated as trifle, to be tossed aside like an old newspaper.</p>
        <p>When we are doing something good, something new. When the truth is near us. It will not be anything that we are accustomed to. The experience will be novel. We will not find a precedent. There will be no footprints on that path. It'll be untrodden and we must go alone. </p>
		<p>Emerson dismisses our prayers, our regrets and even an inclination to travel about as want of self reliance. By roving about and by begging from a foreign entity we fail to cmmonicate with our own internal ocean. Regerts are simillarly useless as it impedes our useful actions. The best  way to repair an evil is by sticking steadfastly to our work. </p>

        <p>They say that to truly understand the words in a book one must have a certain amount of life expereince. The emotions that words inflame must already be simmering somewhere deep inside of us. Self reliance is one of those rare essays on philosophy that speak directly to the heart. How often we've heard the varition of "Trust Thyself" from firends, in TV shows, in pop music and even in relgion. Infact so often this phrase has been flashed across us that it has stopped making any impression.</p>

        <p>Emerson essay is however more than just the feel good "always follow your heart" advice that we are used to recieving. Where the anicent greek pholosophy becomes a burden on life that compells us to examine our every move,Emerson's poetery sets us free by reducing conduct of a good life to two simple words, Self Reliance. </p>
        <p>Achieving the sate of self reliance is however not as easy as it seems. It requires:-</p>
        <ol>
            <l1>Non confirmity to popular opinion</l1>
            <l1>Perfect obidience to the law of our nature</l1>
            <l1>An unconcern to the strength of force opposing our sentiment</l1>
            <l1>Absolute trust towards our instincts</l1>            
        </ol>
<p>In Self reliance Emerson speaks his mind free from all pretenses. It's one thing to critique norms,standards, common views and it's quite another to confute them all together. In Emerson's world there can be no greater law than the law of nature. Everything else is irrelevant. A greater understanding of self reliance can be obtained if it's read with some of his other essays. History for exapmle deals with the connection of events. Compensation talks about gain and loss and whether it's possible for any one to cheat. Oversoul and Spiritual Laws talk about the unification of things. But Self relinace is complete in itself and possibly the most relatable of all essays because it's an idea that we've all heard and believed in, in one form or the other.</p>
