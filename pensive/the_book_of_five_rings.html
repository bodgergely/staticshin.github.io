	<p>Miyamoto Musashi a warrior of Harima province,now sixty,in the year 1645 climbs atop Mt. Iwato to pay his respect to Godess Kwanon and the Buddha and proceeds to distill the lessons of his years of training in a book he calls "Go Rin No sho"(A book of five rings).</p>
<p>He begins with a refelection on his past. At 13 he won his first battle. Between the ages of 13 and 28 he fought many duels against all kinds of warriors and never once suffered a loss. However at 30 he became dissatisfied with his accomplishments.</p> 
<p>This dissatisfaction he attributed to not having mastered the way of strategy. He believed that his victories were either due to a natural ability or due to the inferiority of other schools of strategy or maybe due to fate.</p>
<p>With this conclusion he resolves to dedicate the rest of his life in search of "the principle" and he realizes his goal twenty years later at the age of 50.</p>
