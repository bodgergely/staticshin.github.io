        <h1 class="center">The book of five rings</h1>
	<p>Miyamoto Musashi a warrior of Harima province,now sixty,in the year 1645 climbs atop Mt. Iwato to pay his respect to Godess Kwanon and the Buddha and proceeds to distill the lessons of his years of training in a book he calls "Go Rin No sho"(A book of five rings).</p>
<p>He begins with a refelection on his past. At 13 he won his first battle. Between the ages of 13 and 28 he fought many duels against all kinds of warriors and never once suffered a loss. However at 30 he became dissatisfied with his accomplishments.</p> 
<p>This dissatisfaction he attributed to not having mastered the way of strategy. He believed that his victories were either due to a natural ability or due to the inferiority of other schools of strategy or maybe due to fate.</p>
<p>With this conclusion he resolves to dedicate the rest of his life in search of "the principle" and he realizes his goal twenty years later at the age of 50.</p>
<p>The way is not unique. Each man follows his own path. There is the way of slavation laid down by Buddha. There is the way of governence by Confusious. There's the way of healing as practiced by the doctor. In short there are as many ways as arts and skills. Everyone partices the way as they feel inclined.</p>
<p>The way of the warrior is the way of "pen and the sword". It's a resolute acceptance of death. The warrior's strategy is based on overcoming men and gaining victory by crossing swords.Even a person with no natural ability can be a warrior by sticking to the way. </p>
