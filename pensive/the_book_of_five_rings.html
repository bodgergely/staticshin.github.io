        <h1 class="center">The book of five rings</h1>
	<p>Miyamoto Musashi a warrior of Harima province,now sixty,in the year 1645 climbs atop Mt. Iwato to pay his respect to Godess Kwanon and the Buddha and proceeds to distill the lessons of his years of training in a book he calls "Go Rin No sho"(A book of five rings).</p>
	<p>He begins with a refelection on his past. At 13 he won his first battle. Between the ages of 13 and 28 he fought many duels against all kinds of warriors and never once suffered a loss. However at 30 he became dissatisfied with his accomplishments.</p> 
	<p>This dissatisfaction he attributed to not having mastered the way of strategy. He believed that his victories were either due to a natural ability or due to the inferiority of other schools of strategy or maybe due to fate.</p>
	<p>With this conclusion he resolves to dedicate the rest of his life in search of "the principle" and he realizes his goal twenty years later at the age of 50.</p>
	<p>The way is not unique. Each man follows his own path. There is the way of slavation laid down by Buddha. There is the way of governence by Confusious. There's the way of healing as practiced by the doctor. In short there are as many ways as arts and skills. Everyone partices the way as they feel inclined.</p>
	<p>The way of the warrior is the way of "pen and the sword". It's a resolute acceptance of death. The warrior's strategy is based on overcoming men and gaining victory by crossing swords. Even a person with no natural ability can be a warrior by sticking to the way. </p>
	<p>One of the major themes in the book is to apply one strategy to many aspects of life. "Having one thing learn ten thousand things". By truly studying an art and the principle behind it one can learn to apply those princples in situations where the art has no use. Musashi illustrates this point by comparing the art of master carperter to general in the war and novice carperters to his troops.</p>
	<p>A strategy can't be learnt is haste. One has to partice one's art deeply. Learning of a strategy can't be sold just as one can't haste the blooming of a flower. Immature strategy is the cause of grief.</p>
	<p>He places empahis on research and devoting time to learn. One must know that smallest of things and the biggest of tihngs. The deepest of things and the shallowest of things. </p>

	<p>The book is divided into five chapters outlining different aspects of strategy:</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Ground Book: The ground book outlines the way of the strategy. What it takes to acquire knowledge and how one has to proceed about the task of acquiring knowledge "as if it were a clear road mapped on the ground." </li>
	  <li>Water Book: The water book is about felexibility and the need to adopt accoding to the situation. Just like water which assumes the shape of it's container. Sometimes it's just a trickle. At other times it's a wild raging see. The spirit of the warrior must be like water. Calm or wild as the situation calls for. </li>
	  <li>Fire book: The fire book embodies the spirit of fighting. Fire is fierce and so must be the warrior. When in a battle the intention to defeat the enemy must be absolute. Any action that does not set up for a vitory in the battle is futileand a watste of energy. </li>
	  <li>Wind Book: The wind book is concerned with tradations. It's important to study the old ways so that one may learn new. One can't know oneselfif one does not know others. Studying the tradion will help the warrior is staying the course and not diverging from the path.</li>
	  <li>Book of the void: Void is nothing. And so attaining this principle is not attaining this principle. Once one learns to understand the rythym of situation the right movement follows naturally.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Musashi places big emphasis on not getting attached to any particular weapon. Or more generally to any one particuar way. It's important to change apporach when the situation calls for it.</p>
	<p>
	  <em>This is a truth: when you sacrifice your life, you must make fullest use of your weaponry. It is
	    false not to do so, and to die with a weapon yet undrawn.
	  </em>
