        <h1>The truth about political corectness</h1>
        <p>Recently I came upon this article called 
          <a href="http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2015/08/19/op-ed-truth-about-political-correctness">
	    the truth about political corectness
	  </a>. 

	</p>

        <p><em>"It’s just that many people no longer find those jokes funny"</em></p>
        <p>I am starting to get a bit confused here. Should jokes be made potically correct because the audience does not find them funny anymore? Or should they be made politically correct because it is the right thing to do?</p>
        <p>There is quite a bit of difference between the two. For the former there is no way that the author can speak for all kinds of audiences. There may or may not be  a healthy amount of people who find politically incorrect jokes funny. The only way to find out would be by doing a through research. But since no such reseacrh was cited I ask myself "did the author just put in those words to make it sound convincing?" If that is the case then I'd also like to make a statement:-</p>
        <p><em>People are tired of all these lame politically correct jokes.</em></p>
        <p>For the latter case that is the politically incorrect jokes shouldn't be made because they are wrong then one needs to ask oneself wrong in what sense? Lets take the general arguments made against them:-</p>
        <p>1. Because they tend to exclude people</p>
        <p>Bars tend to exclude people who don't drink alcolhol. Should the bars be closed? Swimming pools are not kind to people who don't know how to swim. Should we shut down all the swimming pools? What do people afraid of heights feel about bungee jumping? Should we also take into account the sentiments of a claustarophobic person regarding an underground cave? </p>
        <p>2. They are hurtful</p>
	<p> The jokes can be hurful. Especially if they are taken personally. It's also something that is not as easy to overcome as say a physical challange of running 30 Kms. My personal thoughts on this why be around people who hurt you? Why not take control of your happiness? First the jokes will make you unhappy. Then the sulky attitude. Then it will be indifference and then excessive politeness, then the food, then the roads, then the water, then the weather and in short every small or big thing will make you unhappy. Unless you put in a sincere effort to be happy. It does not come cheap you know.
	  It's the costliest thing in the world. You put your thouhghts to maximize your happiness and you'll forget about things that make you unhappy or those that hurt.</p>
        <p>3. It should't be like this-- people should be supportive and caring</p>
        <p>In an indeal world may be. But that perfection does not exist. Nither in an individual nor in a society. I suppose in a way it's admirable to try to change the attitudes of people. </p>
        <p><em>"Comedy that “punches down” is simply going out of vogue."</em></p>
        <p>While I might agree that the comics the author is talking about don't sound funny when they "punch down" the assertion that politically incorrect jokes are going out of vogue is not true.
	  Just watch an episode of archer and try to count all the "politically incorrect", double meaning, sexist, racial jokes are made in a single scene. Then research a bit on archer's success as a comedy show and see if you can add an exception to the point made above. </p>

        <p><em>"One swallow does not make a Summer" (Phrasing!)</em></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><em>Okay but it's different with archer because it is just fiction</em></p>
        <p></p>
	<p>
	  <em>"I have written extensively about how policing language can sometimes make spaces less safe, not more"</em>
	</p>
        <p>Classic good cop bad cop. Now that the author has run out of critisim she shows a bit of love for us "politically incorrect" by saying that excessive policing can actually be bad for us. According to her we most definitely need to be "politically correct" but only in the right amount.</p>
	<p>
	  <em>"Hey could you tell me  what quatity  of 'political correctness' would be appropriate"?</em>
	</p>
        <p>Since the author never came round to it (Phrasing!) I'm just going to make an assumption (I hope she does not hold it against me). I think that in general for a member of  100 gram of crude jokes would go well with 1kg of political correctness. Though the actual quantity may vary from a person to person. </p>
	  <p>But since I can't really tell whether that was intentional or not I think I should be more charitable in my assessment. Here is my point. You make an argument you stick to it. You can't blow hot and cold in the same breath (Phrasing!) If you don't want </p>
        <p><em>" I would love to engage in thoughtful conversations about this phenomenon"</em></p>
        <p>I've put a lot of thought into this article and I've come to the conclusion.... well actullly no I've not come to a conclusion. But I'm breathing hard. Get it?  </p>
