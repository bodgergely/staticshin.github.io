        <p><em>"The world will never starve for want of wonders; but only for want of wonder."</em></p>
        <p>The essay questions the need of doing extraordinary things in the name of adventure. It challanges the theory advocating the importance of travelling to unknown continenets and climibing higest of mountains to gain viour and zet in life. Instead puts forth a remarkeable idea that even the commonplace existance can be striking if only one chooses to observe the unremarkable and what appears to be oridinary with fasicnation.</p>
        <p>The difference between the two theories is illustrated with the help of a fairy tale. That of Paul and Peter. The two little boys are playing in their garden when they are visited by fairy, disguised as a milkman, who agrees to grant them one wish each. Paul wishes to become a giant so that he can travel from Niagra to Himalayas in an afternoon's stroll. However as he discovers once his wish is fulfilled, once he becomes big enough to cover such great distances with little effort, everything that he held in great awe looses it's awesomeness. The Niagra appears to him no more intresting than tap water and the Himalayas are nothing more than a little cork rockery in his graden.</p>
        <p>Peter makes the opposite request. Insetead of asking to be turned into a giant he wishes the fairy to make him  a pygmy. And at once the things that appeared commonplace become grand and magnificent. The grass truns into a green jungle through wich the rays of the sun shine gold and silver. The playbed transforms into an insurmountable montain standing  in dominanace. His garden that appeared insignificant changes into a land of unending adventures.</p>
        <p>He concludes that <em> "It is from the valley that things look large; it is from the level that things look high"</em>. To make ordinary things extraordinary all one needs to do is put on the "sacred spectales of exxageration". Or in other words change one's point of view. </p>
        <p>While the author makes a case for mavels in everday life I think it would be improper to interpret it as an argument against travelling. When he says that there's a lot to see in your own garden he does not mean that there's nothing to behold elsewhere. The real instruction of the essay, I believe, is that the mere inlcination of going out adventuring is not enough. One must have the desire to observe. One must exert effort not only physical but also mental to gain proper enjoyment out of anything. Otherwise even the most splendid of spectales loose their falavour.</p>
