        <h1 class="center">The mystery of Richard Saunders</h1>
	<p>We start our investigation in the year of 1733, it was the year in which poor richard first published his work. Although his book has lots of useful information we'll confine ourself to the bits and peices which gives us a hint of poor Richard's sate of mind at the time of publishing that can help us in establishing intent. Intent, as dearest reader no dboubt knows, is one of the most important element in establishing a crime.</p>

        <p><strong>Poor Richard Statement in 1733</strong></p>
        <p>Poor Richard was married to a proud and nagging wife whom he loved dearly. Although there was no apparent discord between the pair, behind the scenes, as he admits frankly, his wife did not approve of his habit of reading and his sage like dedication to self improvement. Infact she was so furious with him that she threatend to burn his books on multiple occastions if Richard did not mend his ways and put his time in doing something fruitful, like making money.   </p>
        <p><small>Aside: [Although it's plain that the wife's opinion of her husbad was quite low,  it won't be an udnerstatement to say that she considered Richard to be a bum, the esteemed reader is urged not to be dispositioned against the lady. It is common knowledge that all wives are like her,by that I main vain and naggin. What was true in 18th century is also true in the 21st century. Passage of time has done nothing to improve their nature.Therefore it would be prudent for us to keep away from petty gossip and focus our attention on more important matters. A death is about to be prophesied]</small></p>
        <p> Quite aware of the fact that his bummery would no longer be tolerated in the house, Richard was torn between the love for his wife and his quest for virtue. After much deleberation on the state of affairs he struck a deal with his publisher to print all of his learnings in a book for the good of public and saticfaction of his wife.  </p>
        <p>So far so good</p>
        <p>Leaving aside the household matters there was one remarkable fact about Poor Richards first publication that I would like to bring to the attention of the noble reader. It was a premonition. An ominous presentiment that lead poor richard to apprise the public  of death his good firend , fellow student and rival publisher Mr. Titan Leeds on October 17 1733 at 3:29 PM.After his fatal pronoucement Richard appeals to the public to buy his book if not as a replacement to Mr Titan's journal then as an act of charity to poor Richard. And with those words he assumes a monk like silence for an year. </p>
