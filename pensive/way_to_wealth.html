        <h1 class="center">The mystery of Richard Saunders</h1>
	<p>We start our investigation in the year of 1733, it was the year in which poor richard first published his work. Although his book has lots of useful information we'll confine ourself to the preface which gives us a hint of poor Richard's sate of mind at the time of publishing that can help us in establishing intent. Intent, as dearest reader no dboubt knows, is one of the most important element in establishing a crime.</p>

            <li>A petulant wife</li>

        <p><strong> Analysis of Poor Richard Statement in 1733</strong></p>
        <p>Poor Richard was married to a proud and nagging whife whom he loved dearly. Although there was no apparent discord between the pair, he admits frankly that his wife did not approve of his habit of reading and his sage like dedication to self improvement. Infact she was so furious that she threatend to burn his books on more than one occastion if Richard did not mend his ways and put his time in .   </p>
        <p><small>[Although it was clear that the wife's opinion of her husbad was quite low infact it would not be an udnerstatement to think that she considered Richard to be a bum, the reader is urged not to be dispositioned against her. It is common knowledge that all wives are like that, passage of time has done nothing to improve thier nature. Therefore I believe it would be prudent  ]</small></p>
        <p>Torn between the love for his wife and his quest for virtue poor Richarrd struck a deal with his publisher to  </p>
        <p>So far so good</p>
        <p>COmpications began to arise</p>

        <!--   <li>His wife threatened to burn is books if he made no use of it. She was tired of spinning while Richard spent his time gazing listlessy at the stars. The printer offered a share of profits but hesitated to publish because his friend Mr titan leeds was about to die. </li> -->
