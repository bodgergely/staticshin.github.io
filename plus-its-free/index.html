      <div class="postBody"><p>I have been a playstation plus subscriber for three months now and here is the list of all the games that I got for free</p>

<ul><li>Gravity rush</li><li>Virtue's last reward</li><li>Sine mora</li><li>Velocity Ultra</li><li>Rayman orgins</li><li>Uncharted Golden abyss(though I already had a physical copy of that game)</li><li>Thomas was alone</li></ul>

<p>So that is a total of seven free games in three months. Not just any games mind you. Each and every title that I enumerated in the list is among the finest games on the vita. This is not even counting any other benefits like cloud saves, discounts and early access to demos. Impressive.</p>

<p>Even after experiencing the awesomeness of ps+ I was a bit incredulous. How can they possibly sustain it ? Surely the developers are not making anything off their games sales on ps+?  Well as it turns out sony's ps+ buisness model is quite robust and the developers are in fact <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191966/playstation_plus_good_for_.php?page=1">making money with ps+</a>.Not only have the game developers made  money off ps+ they have also seen increased game sales on their other games.  <strong>Impressive indeed</strong>.</p>

<p>What is even more heartening is the fact that small publishers have a big presence on ps+. For instance I wouldn't have bought <em>virtues last reward</em> ,a game by aksys, just because I have never played a visual novel type game before. But being free on ps+ I gave it a try and I am mighty impressed. Now I am thinking of buying 999 , a prequel of sorts to <em>virtues last reward</em>. </p>

<p>Oh and did I mention that one ps+ subscriber account allows you to get completely different free games on ps3 and vita. This means that if you own both consoles you can get 4 free games each month.  Now I don't  own a ps3 yet so I feel a bit left out. I think I am going to buy one soon just so I can play more free games.</p>

<p><strong>Gasp ! Was this sony's plan all along?</strong></p></div>
