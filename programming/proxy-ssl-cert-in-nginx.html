          <p>
	    Client side certificates allow the server to authenticate the source of the request.
	    The server gives you a key file and a certificate file that you have to send along with 
	    a request for the connection to be established. If everything checks out the server 
	    allows further communication. If it does not the requests from the client are not entertained.In this post 
	    we'll see how to configure a client certificate in nginx for proxying calls to a secure server. 
	  </p>

	  <p> Nginx however can not only serve requests of the client but also act as 
	    a proxy between requests to to other servers (hence the name reverse proxy server) 
	    Nginx's directives allow you to configure both server side and client side certificates. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    Server side certificate: By server side certificate, in this context, 
	    we mean that the downstream requests, that is the requests 
	    coming in to nginx from the client, must be over a secure connection.  
	    In other words the<strong> client establishes the authenticity of the server</strong>. 
	  </p>
	  <p>Client side certificate: By client side certificate, in this context, we mean that 
	    all the upstream requests, that is the requests going out of nginx 
	    are authenticated. In other words the <strong>server establishes the authenticity of the client</strong>. 
	    Since the requests 
	    going from nginx to other servers are called proxies what we mean by client side 
	    certificates is called proxy certificate in nginx's world.
	  </p>
          <p>Server side certificates are configured by <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html">ngx_http_module</a> where as the proxy certificates are handled by the directives in the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ssl_certificate">ngx_http_proxy</a> module.  
	  </p>
	  <p><em>"So how do the client side certificates work?"</em></p>
	  <p>Essentially the purpose of client side certificates is authentication of the client by the server. The client sends it's certificate to the server. The server checks whether the client certificate is valid. 
	    If it is the connection is established for future requests and if not the request for connection is denied.  
	  </p>
	  <p><em>"Where are they used?"</em></p>
	  <p>Since the responsibility of managing client side certificates is on the client, they are generally used in scenarios where determining the identity of the client becomes essential. Consider that you have an api that you want to expose to a set of known users. In that case you can issue each user a certificate and keep a copy for yourself. Only when a user sends the right certificate you allow access to the apis otherwise simply send an unauthorized response.</p>
	  <p><em>"Is there any benefit in letting nginx handle the certificates?"</em></p>
	  <p>Yes. For one ssl handling in nginx is extremely optimized. It's fast and light. And second it's easy. 
	    All you got to do is add few directives and you are set.</p>
	  <p><em>"what about the ssl_verify_client directive"</em></p>
	  <p>The <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_verify_client">ssl_verify_client</a> 
	    directive is for the scenario where nginx works as your server to entertain requests from the client. Where as the proxy_ssl directive that we've discussing so far is for the scenario where nginx acts as a client and proxies requests to to other servers.   
	  </p>
	  <p><em>"What is your favorite animal?"</em></p>
	  <p>Ahh.. hard to say. I really like cows. They are so milky... and they can chew all day long. 
	    I've tried chewing gums a couple of times but strain becomes unbearable after 3 hours. 
	    I have to sip on fluids for the rest of the day to restore myself.
