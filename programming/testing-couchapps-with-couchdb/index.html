      <h1>Testing couchapps with couchdb</h1>
      <span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma,  Wed Sep 17 2014</span>
      <div class="postBody"><p>Are you using <a href="https://github.com/couchapp/couchapp">couchapp</a> or <a href="http://github.com/benoitc/erica">erica</a> for managing couchdb design documents? 
Do you feel a bit dirty every time you <code>push</code> a new <code>design document</code> to couchdb 
without testing it first? And are you tired of being dirty all the time? Well then this 
article will teach you to clean your couchdb design docs in fragrant soap water before 
pushing it to your production server so you can be sure all your production code is clean<br>and shiny or something along those lines....</p>
<h3>What are we doing?</h3>
<p>We will write simple tests using couchdb show and list functions to test<br>parts of couchdb design docs. We will run these functions on our local couchdb 
instance before pushing it to the production server and then we will lay out a formal 
plan for designing CABS. No not those cabs silly!  <strong>C</strong>ouchapp <strong>A</strong>utomated <strong>B</strong>uild <strong>S</strong>ystems.</p>
<h3>Show and list?</h3>
<p>Yes sir. Show and lists functions are a terribly underrated feature of couchdb. The purpose of show 
function is to transform a document into a format that is consumable by the client like suppose 
transforming a json document into an html page so that it could render nicely on a web browser. </p>
<p>Similarly a list function was designed to transform the output of views into a format that is 
consumable by the client. </p>
<p>But here is the thing. Show and list functions can be used to execute arbitrary server side code. 
Well almost... there are only a few built in functions that show and list are allowed to use
but even  it's limited power  gives us tremendous flexibility. We are going to exploit them
to run server side tests for us. </p>
<h3>It's time for some action</h3>
<p>We are going to start by testing a view function. Consider this view </p>
<pre><code>function(doc){
    if(doc.created_at){
    emit(doc.created_at,null);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The view is pretty straight forward. It only sorts the documents based 
on the <code>created_at</code> field. So how can we test this view? Consider this list function </p>
<pre><code>function(head,req){
    var row = getRow();
    var test_results = [];
    var is_correct_view = req.path.indexOf("general")!==-1;
    if(!is_correct_view){ return toJSON({"failed":"test performed against the wrong view"});}
    while(row){
    var pass_condition = new Date(row.key*1000).getTime()&gt;0;
    if(!pass_condition) return toJSON({falied:"unexpected result"});
    test_results.push(true);
    row = getRow();
    }
    return toJSON({"passed":"view tests passed:"+test_results.length.toString()}); 

}</code></pre>
<p>What this list function does is it checks that the documents emitted by the 
the view contain a key that is a valid date. If the date is valid the test pass
and if it is invalid the test fails. Some points to note here</p>
<p>In line #3</p>
<p><code>if(!is_correct_view){ return toJSON({"failed":"test performed against the wrong view"});}</code></p>
<p>we check if the list is being executed against the correct view. Remember 
that list functions can be executed against any view in the same or different design document. 
While this is certainly a handy feature we only want our test cases to execute against the views 
for which they were written. Consequently the test will fail if it is attempted to be executed 
against a different view. </p>
<p>In line number #7 </p>
<p><code>if(!pass_condition) return toJSON({failed:"unexpected result"});</code></p>
<p>We fail the test if even one document does not pass. This might sound stringent 
but it is not really. A view should index a document only if it passes the map function. 
Our map function indexes the document only if it contains a date. If the indexed document 
has no date then it should not be indexed at all. Hence the result must fail. We can probably 
do better by outputting the docs for which the test fails. </p>
<p>Otherwise we output a test passed message along with the count of docs the test was run against. </p>
<p>To run this test we just <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Formatting_with_Show_and_List#Listing_Views_with_CouchDB_0.10_and_later">call this list function</a>. To limit the number of documents passed to the view we can use the <code>limit=number</code> query parameter. </p>
<p>Let us take an example of slightly more complex view:- </p>
<pre><code>function(doc){
    if(doc.tname){
    var rent = parseInt(doc.rent);
    emit([doc.tcurrency,doc.temail,doc.tname,doc.created_at],rent);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>And the corresponding test list function </p>
<pre><code>function(head,req){
    var row = getRow();
    var array_equals = require("modules/array_equals").array_equals;
    var doc_keys = ["_id","_rev","created_at","tname","tcurrency","rent","temail"];   
    var test_results = [];
    var is_correct_view = req.path.indexOf("tenant_details")!==-1; 

    if(!is_correct_view){ return toJSON({"failed":"test performed against the wrong view"});}

    while(row){
    var keys = Object.keys(row.doc);
        var pass_condition = array_equals(doc_keys,keys)&amp;&amp; row.key.length===4;
    if(!pass_condition) {
        return toJSON({"failed":"unexpected results"});

    }

        if(pass_condition)test_results.push(true);
    row=getRow();
    }
    if(test_results.length&gt;0){    
    return toJSON({"passed":"view tests passed:"+test_results.length.toString()}); 
    }
    return toJSON({"failed":"by default"});
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can probably tell our test function has become a bit more complicated. But it still has 
the original ideas ingrained into it. The list is only run against the view for which it was 
designed. In this case the "tenant_details" view. And as before<br>all the documents must pass this test.  </p>
<p>"So what's changed then?"</p>
<p>Good question. This time we are testing for the ordering of emitted keys instead of the 
testing for the type of emitted keys. A careful observer might have noticed line #2</p>
<p><code>var array_equals = require("modules/array_equals").array_equals;</code></p>
<p>array_equals is the function that takes in two arrays and check if they are 
equal or not. </p>
<pre><code>array_equals([1,2,3],[1,2,3]) //true
array_equals([1,2,3],[3,2,1]) //false
array_equals([1,2,3],[1,2,3,4]) //false
array_equals([1,2,3],[a,b,c]) //false</code></pre>
<p>with this in mind I created a </p>
<p><code>var doc_keys = ["_id","_rev","created_at","tname","tcurrency","rent","temail"];</code></p>
<p>doc_keys variable and tested that in each row the doc object properties is exactly equal to the previously
defined <code>doc_keys</code> array. </p>
<p>One main difference though is in how we run this test. Along with a <code>limit=number</code> we also 
pass in a <code>include_docs=true</code> parameter. </p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>That is because in couchdb the keys in the result set are emitted as values. For instance if you do : </p>
<p><code>emit(doc.created_at,null)</code></p>
<p>in the result set you will get</p>
<p><code>1410953047410</code></p>
<p>That is the actual value of the emitted key: you don't know what property of the doc is being emitted. 
So as a workaround to this we fetch in the original document and simply compare if they contain 
the right keys.  </p>
<p>It should be noted that this is not a general solution. This works for me because I have 
only one view that indexes one type of document. It is not uncommon to have multiple views
that index the same document in different ways. But the strategy remains the same. You 
have to test the results returned by your view. Whether you test if the type of key or if the document contains valid properties,
 or if the order of keys is as expected it does not matter. </p>
<h3>"Is there any point to testing the views? "</h3>
<p>Good question once more. Yes and no. Having a test for views is during development<br>absolutely invaluable as it quickly allows you to make changes to your functions 
without while being confident that correct results are being returned. Yes it will need 
more maintenance on your part as you will have to update the tests as well as the views 
but I think that the effort is minimal as compared to the peace of mind it brings.  </p>
<p>For instance I am thinking of changing my </p>
<p><code>emit(doc.created_at,null)</code></p>
<p>view to </p>
<p><code>emit([year,month,day],null)</code></p>
<p>This means that I will have to change my test list function to re-assemble this 
array into a valid date. It is pretty simple. I can  use the built in date functions 
to convert this array into the time stamp and then compare the value with the doc.created_at 
that I get from the include_docs parameter. </p>
<p>But to be honest testing views is pretty much useless in production. Why? Because production 
views should be static. If you are running tests on production views it means that they are changing 
too often which means that you are doing something wrong. </p>
<h3>It is not just the views that you can test.</h3>
<p>Remember that show and list functions can execute arbitrary javascript on server side. 
So besides views you can test any common js modules. You can even export your show and list functions 
and test them in other show and list functions! </p>
<p>But probably the best reason to test with couchdb is that you don't need a mock environment. You 
test against the data that is real and the one against which you are already developing the application. 
That is a pretty big win if you ask me.</p>
<h3>Automation as promised</h3>
<p>Once we have test cases written it is pretty easy to automate it mainly because couchdb already 
provides a nice http api to execute the tests (or call the list functions). Here is what we want to do:- </p>
<ol>
<li>Push the design doc locally</li>
<li>Run all the tests. </li>
<li>If all the tests pass push the doc to the server. </li>
</ol>
<p>Now if you are using erica and couchpp you are probably already familiar with the .couchapprc file 
where you define the local and prod databases. This makes our job a lot easier. Here is the plan. </p>
<ol>
<li>Pick any automation tool you like. Grunt? buildify? shell script? </li>
<li>After changing your design docs run an os command <code>couchapp push</code> (or <code>erica push</code>)  from the script. </li>
<li>Once the doc has been push to couchdb make a series of http requests to list or show functions. You 
can easily store the urls in an array. </li>
<li>If all the calls result in <code>pass</code> Run another os command <code>couchapp push prod</code> (<code>erica push prod</code>) to 
push your design doc to the production database.</li>
<li>If a call results in <code>failed</code> stop the tests and print out a message on the console. </li>
</ol>
<p>Pretty simple no.</p>
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>Good tests are hard to write. The intention of this article was not to show you how 
to write good tests. To be honest I don't know how to write good tests as well. But I know 
that some tests are better than no test. And just like your code your testing strategy can be improved 
over time as you understand your own application better. Couchdb gives you some pretty powerful tools to 
test your application. Exploit them! </p>
