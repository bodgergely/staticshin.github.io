      <h1>What does _security secure in couchdb?</h1>
      <span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma,  Tue Jan 13 2015</span>
      <div class="postBody"><p>The database level security is controlled in couchdb by a special document called 
_security. The _security document is unique to every database. Let's see what it looks like.</p>
<p>Taking an example from <a href="http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/api/database/security.html">couchdb docs</a>:-</p>
<pre><code>{
    "admins": {
        "names": [
            "superuser"
        ],
        "roles": [
            "admins"
        ]
    },
    "members": {
        "names": [
            "user1",
            "user2"
        ],
        "roles": [
            "developers"
        ]
    }
}</code></pre>
<h3>The construction of _security document</h3>
<p>Every _security document consists of two mandatory fields called <code>admins</code> and <code>members</code>. Both admins and 
members are json objects that in turn are made up of 
arrays called <code>names</code> and <code>roles</code>. The name in an admin or a member property must be the name  of 
the user stored in _users database. When couchdb 
<a href="http://www.staticshin.com/programming/easy-user-accounts-management-with-couchdb/">authenticates a user</a> 
from the _users database it 
can run checks against the _security document of each database to determine whether the authenticated 
user is an admin or a member. </p>
<p>The roles property on the other hand is free form--- meaning you can supply any value in the roles array. 
What roles you choose would depend upon your application. If for example you are making an online library 
with couchdb you could use "librarian" and "reader" as roles. The significance of roles is that you can 
add role based checks in <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Document_Update_Validation">document validate functions</a> 
and choose who updates what documents. </p>
<h3>Difference between an admin and a member</h3>
<p>An admin is authorized to perform CRUD on _design and _security documents. </p>
<p>A member can only read or write normal documents--- all documents except _design and the _security documents. </p>
<h3>Effect of adding a _security document</h3>
<p>Once you add a _security to the database then the database can only be accessed by the person who 
is a part of the _security document. Any un-authorized person would be forbidden from accessing the database. </p>
<h3>So what does the _security secure?</h3>
<p>The conclusion is pretty easy to draw. couchdb offers <em>minimal</em> read level security on the normal documents (that is all documents except the special _design and _security documents). Minimal because once you set either an admin or a member in the _security document then only the person that has been added to _security object can read from the database. But you 
can't set conditional reading. Any member or any admin will be able to read all normal documents. 
That is there is no validate_on read function (In <a href="https://github.com/rcouch/rcouch/wiki/Validate-documents-on-read">rcouch</a> there is a validate_doc_read function). </p>
<p>On the other hand couchdb offers full write level security. 
You can add conditional checks on who creates, updates or deletes a 
document using document update functions. </p>
<p><strong>In short</strong> couchdb has two levels of security: - </p>
<p>the server level (which is set by the configuration files)</p>
<p>and the database level(which is set by the _security document)</p>
<p><strong>The _security document</strong> consists of members and admins.</p>
<p>admins have the ability to write, read and update special documents of the database (_design and _security) 
where as the the members only have permission to read and write the normal documents (that is all documents except _design and _security). </p>
<p>Finally the write level protection can be enhanced by the use of document validate functions. [9]</p>
