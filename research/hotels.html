    <p><strong>Getting users</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Find people from stackexchange travel board, use api to automate information gathering.
      </li>
      <li>Collect information from airbnb and couchsurfing profile pages.
      </li>
      <li>Start a discourse discussion board to provide travel related information. 
      </li>
      <li>Re-purpose the marketing data gathered from various sources and make it freely available  as a lookup search engine that can be used by the travelers/researchers to study their host/ the property. Other booking websites are not quite good at this. Think of it as a content discovery platform, something that will keep the travelers coming back and increase our app engagement.  
      </li>
      <li>Appeal to Eco tourists</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fixed price Per Booking</li>
      <li>Fixed price Per Day of use </li>
      <li>Fixed price according to No of rental properties managed</li>
      <li>Fixed monthly fee</li>
      <li>Fees based on usage criteria ex $1 per 100 support requests via chat, $1 per 1000 hits on website. If none of these criteria are fulfilled we charge the user nothing. </li>
      <li>Inventory management fees (based on number of listings the user has) such that if the user inventory is booked via our website we charge a fixed fee. </li>
      <li>Provide custom hosting for discussion forums. We should be able to provide a while label discourse to help tour operators/people running popular travel blogs increase their engagement with their audience. It could be another stream of income. </li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Analytics for users</strong></p>
    <div>
      <p>We can use google anaytics  to track the webstes <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">across multiple domains and subdomains</a>. We can also pull results using the analytics api for every domain/subdomain. </p>
      <p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">node js</a> client library for GA. Bindings are also available in <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/libraries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">other languages</a></p>
      <p>We should also provide simplified analytics summary for the users. The summary should be visible on a separate screen in the mobile app. Some ideas on parameters that can be tracked:-  </p>
      <ul>
	<li>From which countries he gets visits. He should be able to see the country name and the number of visitors he got from that country. Ex: India: 203</li>
	<li>Number of hits per month </li>
	<li>Number of chat requests</li>
	<li>Number of bookings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending upon the success of the analytics feature we may also add other parameters to tracking:- </p>
      <ul>
	<li>On what listings he got most hits</li>
	<li>From what country/region he got his most bookings</li>
	<li>How is property doing with respect to other users in the same area?</li>
	<li>On what days he got overbooked?</li>
	<li>On what days the bookings got cancelled?</li>
	<li>What is the occupancy rate of his property? </li>
	<li>What % of people who booked actually showed up? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on the numbers we may also provide him tips on maximizing his occupancy rate.  Or at least encourage him to talk of the discussion forums so that he may get help from the community. </p>
