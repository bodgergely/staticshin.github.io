      <h1>Investigating Ghost for use as a booking engine</h1>
      <p>One of the best things about ghost is that it's very lightweight. It saves all of its data to sqlite which makes the entire application highly embeddable. This works very well for us if we want to deploy multiple instances of the same application for different users. All we need to do is find out a way to aggregate the data from multiple sources.Here we are investigating the use of ghost as a spawnable booking engine:-</p>
      <p><u><strong>PROS</strong></u></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lots and lots of <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/">free and beautiful</a>
	  themes that we can use as it is. Lots of customizability options in the default theme as well.
	  <small>[Masonry looks nice and clean]</small>
	</li>
        <li>A decent tagging system that we can use to categorize our listings</li>
        <li>Post recommendations that can be re purposed as listing recommendations</li>
        <li>A side menu bar that can be re-tooled to </li>
        <li>A header image for post file that can be used to create a carousal for property photos</li>
        <li>A simple administration panel that we can build on top of for specific requirements of our application (Mostly integration with calenders and making the default label names more suitable for use in the hospitality industry)</li>
      </ol>
      <p><u><strong>Cons of ghost</strong></u></p>
      <ol>
          <li>Sqlite is a new database for me. Which means that there is a slightly steeper learning curve. </li>
          <li>
	    Ghost is dropping support for later versions of sqlite
            <small>[Although the latest stable version (0.11) is good enough for our usecase]</small>
	  </li>
          <li>The editor is not suitable for the people we are trying to target.
	    Markdown is not something that they'll be willing to learn.
	  </li>
          <li>We may need to design additional screens to capture the meta information</li>
      </ol>
