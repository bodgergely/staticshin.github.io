      <h1>Investigating Ghost for use as a booking engine</h1>
      <p>One of the best things about ghost is that it's very lightweight. It saves all of its data to sqlite which makes the entire application highly embeddable. This works very well for us if we want to deploy multiple instances of the same application for different users. All we need to do is find out a way to aggregate the data from multiple sources.Here we are investigating the use of ghost as a spawnable booking engine:-</p>
      <p><u><strong>PROS</strong></u></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Lots and lots of <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org/themes/free/">free and beautiful</a>
	  themes that we can use as it is. Lots of customizability options in the default theme as well.
	  <small>[Masonry looks nice and clean]</small>
	</li>
        <li>A decent tagging system that we can use to categorize our listings</li>
        <li>Post recommendations that can be re purposed as listing recommendations</li>
        <li>A side menu bar that can be re-tooled to </li>
        <li>A header image for post file that can be used to create a carousal for property photos</li>
        <li>A simple administration panel that we can build on top of for specific requirements of our application (Mostly integration with calenders and making the default label names more suitable for use in the hospitality industry)</li>
      </ol>
      <p><u><strong>Cons of ghost</strong></u></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sqlite is a new database for me. Which means that there is a slightly steeper
	  <a href="/study/sqlite.html">learning</a> curve. </li>
        <li>
	  Ghost is dropping support for later versions of sqlite
          <small>[Although the latest stable version (0.11) is good enough for our usecase]</small>
	</li>
        <li>The editor is not suitable for the people we are trying to target.
	  Markdown is not something that they'll be willing to learn.
	</li>
        <li>We may need to design additional screens to capture the meta information</li>
      </ol>

    <div id="new_cms">
      <h1>An embeddable dynamic cms</h1>
      <p>So I've been thinking, instead of modifying all of the already built content management systems why don't we create our own little CMS that can be used to serve the specific requirements of our prospects? The idea is that we'll create a generic cms that will have the ability to store, query and modify the data. Nothing more, nothing less. Once we have the data api ready we can focus our attention on building components that can present this data into different formats. </p>
      <p><strong>What will be the components of a generic cms?</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>An editor to manage the content. We can use <a href="https://quilljs.com/">quill</a></li>
        <li id="temp_comp">Lots and lots of <a href="#getting_themes">opensource themes</a>, templatized (we'll write a script to automate this operation) to support our data model</li>
	<li>A client side script that will morph the cms engine into different front ends on a <a href="#temp_comp">given template</a>. For example the same cms will work as a booking engine, an ecommerce platform (with the help of simple cart plugin) a portfolio website depending upon the client requirements. Of course while a cms can work as different apps it can't work as different apps at run time. At any given moment a cms will either be a booking engine or an ecommerce platform. Not both.</li>
        <li>A unified admin panel where the end user can edit his content.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Why not use any of the existing content management systems?</strong></p>
      <p>Because they are too heavy. After finding an <a href="/study/sqlite.html#http_rel_json">embeddable webserver + database combo</a> we can safely create applications that can be spawned on demand for our users. If they get too big they can be easily moved to a different server without affecting the services for any of our existing clients. This way we can not only simplify our operational management but also create applications that are personalized for each of our clients. Win win.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="getting_themes">
      <p> Themes will be one of the most important
        <a href="#temp_component">components</a> of our cms. Consequently we should spend effort in creating a set of customized themed templates that our users can choose from to style their cms. I've identified blog post themes as very basic type of theme that is both easily available and flexible enough to be morphed in order to suit the requirements of different kinds of cms. I've decided to go with blog themes as a starting point. Here's my reasoning:-
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Every blog post theme comes with a basic master--> detail setup. Here the master is a list of items and the detail is a view of a specific item. This basic setup can be customized to suit the requirements of any kind of cms.</li>
							     <li>There are lots of opensource static site generators that have become popular these days. For these generators the OS community has created 100s of excellent themes. We can reuse these themes for our cms as well.</li>
							     <li>Perhaps the most important reason is we don't have the development bandwith to do everything. We should focus on creating the core services (meaning the api layer, the client side scripts tol present the interface and the server side infrastructure) that'll bring in the money and use anything we can get from elsewhere. This means that we need to design a system that plays well with components that are not built for it explicitly. It may sound complex but it's not that hard to implement.</li>
							     </ol>
