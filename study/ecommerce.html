      <h1>Ecommerce Trends and Stats</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
	  Ecommerce is growing 23% year-over-year,
	  yet 46% of American small businesses do not have a website
	</li>
        <li>67% of Millennials and 56% of Gen Xers prefer to shop on online rather than in-store.</li>
        <li>
	  Parents spend 61% more online than non-parents ($1,071 vs. $664).
          <small>Maybe because they have more responsibilites and
	    online shopping takes less time than going to a store?
	  </small>
	</li>
        <li>
	  Men and women both report spending 5 hours per week shopping online.

	</li>
        <li id="shipping">
	  63% of suburban shoppers share that shipping costs are their least favorite part of online shopping and 72% of females and 59% of males have decided to abandon their purchase because of shipping costs.
          <small>This should mean that for items where there is no shipping cost involved people would be mor einclined to buy online rather than offline. I should keep this in mind.</small>
	</li>
        <li>
	  43% of online shoppers have made a purchase while in bed.
          <small>
	    Although this seems like an irrelevant little point, it does highlight the comfort that online shopping brings to the shoppers. If I can capture this sentiment not only for the shoppers but also for shop owners (by making it easier for them to manage their shops online) on the main page it will hopefully help me
	    to sell the service to a decent number of people.
	  </small>
	</li>
        <li>
	  78% of online shoppers want more images from ecommerce sites.
          <small>No surprises here. Everybody would like to see what they are buying.</small>
	</li>
        <li>
	  69% of online shoppers want more reviews from ecommerce sites.
	  <small>
	    This ties together well with the <a href="/study/hotels.html#travel_r">insight</a>
	    that we got from the hospitality industry
	  </small>
	</li>
        <li>
	  55% of all ecommerce sales are done through branded stores, vs. 45% via marketplaces.
          <small>This is a very significant point that prooves the importance of having a  brand. The <a href="/study/hotels.html#branding_hos">question</a> remains the same though:- Can small shops create a brand name for themselves to warrant the shopper to go to his site instead of a marketplace? I say yes. But we'll have to wait and see what the results of this experiment will be.</small>
	</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p><small>[We want to be able to create custom ecommerce apps using <a href="#reaction">opensource solutions</a>. Just like forums our first application will be built for the <a href="/study/hotels.html">hotels</a> industry but we'll be branching out to other areas. Below is some research on popular ecommerce applications]</small></p>
    <h1>SAP Hybris</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Hybris is a software for commerce,marketing,revenue and sales.</p>
      <p><strong>Features</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li id="cock">The Customer Service Cockpit pulls customer data together in one place, allowing customer
	  service agents to serve their clients’ needs regardless of channel. <small>[We can replicate this feature with our <a href="/study/forums.html#help_desk">forum helpdesk</a> idea, even hybris has a forum integration with <a href="/study/forums.html#sap_jam">sap jam</a> that they encourage their users to buy]</small></li>
        <li>The internationalization helps brands to serve an audience around the world</li>
        <li>Manage content – and your entire catalog – from one place.</li>
        <li>Manage different businesses from a single platform, including your relationships with different suppliers, distributors and partners.</li>
        <li>Make order processing across all channels quick and easy, including complex arrangements such as bulk ordering, order replenishment and multi-channel fulfillment.</li>
        <li>Enable B2B customers to manage their own accounts and place orders. They can assign rights to employees, set up purchasing limits, and maintain individual budgets.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Lafayette Case Study observations</strong></p>
      <p><small>[Hybris did a case study with a major french fashion store. The study highlights how hybris solution was used to replace their old crufty electronic store. I note down my observations below.]</small></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apparently its hard for a company with billion dollars in revenue to create a simple ecommerce platform (which is nothing more than a content management system really).The in house team could not even build a software that allows dynamic updation of store catalogue [I find it <strong>hard</strong> to <strong>swallow</strong> but it indicates that there is a market for dedicated ecommerce platforms. Amazon is not the be all end all of electronic stores].</li>
        <li>The language of the study indicates that the product was custom built for the store. Its as if every feature of the product was designed specifically to alleviate their pain [<small>That's what every company wants their users to believe</small>] .For ex the study boasts that the brand is known for listening and responding to their customers' needs and therefore the brand went with their customer service <a href="#cock"><strong>cock</strong>pit</a> product. However I believe the real reason they signed up for it was because one of <strong>cock</strong>pit's sales representative pushed the feature too <strong>hard</strong>, the "brand" had too much money to burn and they were just too exhausted with their day to day operations to deliberate on IT decisions. So they let the "experts" chose for them. [<small>And it's quite plain to see how hybris has gone to great lengths to establish their expertise in the market by conducting seminars and publishing papers and doing a PR story on founders struggling to put the idea out when they were just little kinds in college. Standard stuff.</small>]. We won't be taking this approach but there are still some lessons to be learnt on the art of product building/selling. </li>
        <li>The project took 9 months to complete. <small>[9 months? aha!]</small></li>
        <li>40 million unique visitors in 2013. [<small>We should be able to use this
	    number as the test data</small>]</li>
      </ol>
      <div id="yaas">
	<p><strong>YAAS</strong></p>
	<p>[<small>YAAS exposes sap hybris components as a service [They call it CAAS i.e. commerce as a service] that allows its customers to have more control over the product development. Every small/big thing that goes into making an ecommerce application is exposed as a service to the developers. Pricing is based on number of api calls per month. So the api calls are monitored</small>]</p>
	<ol>
          <li>Microservice based architecture. Either build new applications or extend existing ones.
	    API based approach.</li>
          <li><em>"you can focus on building an amazing customer experience"</em>.yaas recognizes that a unique user interface would be important for stores to get their branding right so they encourage the users to use their api driven service. To facilitate the UI building part they have created <a href="#ui-component">opensource templates</a> that simplifies the process. Brilliant.</li>
          <li>Instant provisioning, autoscale and mashup are key selling points. Users can pick and use the components they want.</li>
          <li>YAAS also offers a marketplace where developers can publish their own apps that can be used by other customers with a pay per use model.</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>Superbowl 50 case study</strong></p>
	<ol>
          <li>Took 2 weeks for a small team to assemble a microsite</li>
          <li>Because of the pay per use nature of the website the site was taken down after the event was over.</li>
          <li>Looks like yaas could not get a testimonial from the superbowl 50 team so they just "invented" it themselves. The website has a prominent quote from the SVP of yaas (they call him SVP of "hybris as a service" [<small>just admire the brilliant spin from the copywriter for a moment</small>]).  Man this is desperate!</li>

      <h1>Klarna</h1>
      <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Klarna offers a <a href="https://developers.klarna.com/en">developer api</a> platform. The api allows you to do orders management, integrate a checkout page and payments page. Standard stuff.</li>
        <li>Klarna has a public <a href="https://www.klarna.com/uk/shop-directory">shop directory</a> and a public <a href="https://www.klarna.com/uk/business">case study of businesses</a>. Some of the customers on that page can become an ideal target for our forum software that can help them build communities just like the <a href="/study/forums.html#sap_jam">sap jam platform</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Klarna as an ecommerce platform has limited information to give. Its main focus is is on the payments and it's done quite a bit of work on building seamless checkout experiences. Our focus should be to study the customers of klarna and see the common functionality that we can replicate from them. Also explore the possibility if we can sell any of our other services to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="reaction">
      <h1>Reaction</h1>
      <ol>
	<li>It's a single page app which means that it should be ideal for small shop owners, especially our target audience of vacation rental providers. More importantly the app is built ground up to facilitate customization of the store. They believe in the brand value of the product. </li>
	<li>It's being built as a conversion first platform. What this means is that a retailer will be able to offer dynamic promotions, pricing and personalized merchandising.</li>
        <li>The reaction forums are a good example of how a <a href="https://forums.reactioncommerce.com/">community</a> can be created around an application. <small>[They started the discussion even before the app was out and posted topics not only related to their platform but also that helped other people by mentioning various resources that can aid in learning about the platform and the tools upon which its built.]</small></li>
        <li id="database_url">Reaction has a config file in which we can <a href="https://docs.reactioncommerce.com/reaction-docs/master/configuration">set a database to use</a>.
          <small>
            [The <a href="https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/625">github issue</a> that explains how we can use an existing mongo db dabase with meteor application]
	    [We can configure meteor to use a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10588038/how-do-i-use-the-existing-mongodb-in-a-meteor-project">pre installed mongodb database</a>,hook meteor into existing <a href="https://github.com/oortcloud/unofficial-meteor-faq#user-content-how-do-i-hook-into-an-existing-running-mongodb-instance"> mongodb database</a>, for a mongodb installation with multiple database we can <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11198014/meteor-custom-mongodb-during-development">instruct meteor</a> to use a particular one.]</small>
	</li>
                      
      </ol>
      <p>
	<s><small>[Since it runs on mongo db we need to be really careful of our deployments. Too many mongo db instances can quickly eat up our available ram. Plus it seems that there will be lots of websockets involved so that means more server resources, we need to build our pricing scheme appropriately]</small>
	</s>
        <small>
	  [We don't need to worry about this any more.
	  Since we'll be using <a href="/activity-logs/todo.html#mongo_service">a single mongo db</a>
	  container with connections
	  <a href="/study/mongodb.html#proxy_pool">proxied via nginx</a>]
	</small>
      </p>
      <p><small>[A hosted platform is offered at $2500 a month. We can build our own usage based pricing scheme like yaas/shopify]</small></p>
      <p><small>[We'll start by selling the service to people who don't need to ship their products. i.e just like forums it'll start it's life as an integration with ellobed. Later on we can figue out the shipping method integrations and offer the platform to people who have to ship physical products]</small></p>

    <div id="spree">
      <h1>spree</h1>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_static_content">Managing</a> static content in spree. The static content can be stored in the database.</p>
      <p>Ok so it seems that the spree api <a href="https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree-multi-domain/issues/141">won't work</a> in case of multi-domain setup. My initial understanding was that the multidomain extension would also provide its own api to handle the case of multiple stores. But I guess I was wrong.
	<small>[I should be able to use the product search api to perform search with store_id as the parameter]</small>
      </p>

    </div>
    <div id="woo_commerce">
      <h1>Woo commerce</h1>
      <ol>
          <li>One of the most important things to remember is that woo commerce is a wordpress plugin. It is significant because we will be running a multisite deployment of wordpress (if we do) and we'll need to find a way to integrate the same plugin to multiple websites. The expereince that we gained with nodebb plugin management should come in handy.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="airbnb">
      <h1>Airbnb</h1>
      <p>Airbnb uses <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-programming-languages-does-Airbnb-use">ruby</a> for its core. It'll be interesting to know whether they use spree/active merchant? I bet they do.</p>
      <p><strong>Hypernova</strong></p>
      <p>The airbnb <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova">hypernova</a> project is a service that renders templates. Now on the surface of it I would have dismissed this project without any second thoughts, but I've gotten some information that makes this discovery significant. There was a comment on a techcrunch article that said airbnb is looking to create a product that lets its homeowners create websites for their listings. If that is the case then they'll definitely want a template rendering service. Otherwise it's useless to have something like this in your production environment.  </p>
      <p>Their <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates">date range</a> picker looks nice but its written in react so I won't be able to use it (at least until I learn react).</p>
      <p>We can use airbnb <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/superset">superset</a> for creating reports and analytics. The question is though can we share these reports with our users to create another revenue stream? [Yes we can <a href="http://airbnb.io/superset/security.html?highlight=permissions#gamma">there is a permissions</a> system] </p>
      <p>They also have an <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/stemcell">Ec2</a> instance creation tool. Looks good but not sure how this is different from the command line tools that aws already provides. Will have to study this in more detail. </p>
