    <h1>SAP Hybris</h1>

      <p>Hybris is a software for commerce,marketing,revenue and sales.</p>
      <p><strong>Lafayette Case Study observations</strong></p>
      <p><small>[Hybris did a case study with a major french fashion store. The study highlights how hybris solution was used to replace their old crufty electronic store. I note down my observations below.]</small></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apparently its hard for a company with billion dollars in revenue to create a simple ecommerce platform (which is nothing more than a content management system really).The in house team could not even build a software that allows dynamic updation of store catalogue [I find it <strong>hard</strong> to <strong>swallow</strong> but it indicates that there is a market for dedicated ecommerce platforms. Amazon is not the be all end all of electronic stores].</li>
          <li>The language of the study indicates that the product was custom built for the store. Its as if every feature of the product was designed specifically for them. For ex the study boasts that the brand is known for listening and responding to their customers' needs and therefore they used the customer service <a href="#cock"><strong>cock</strong>pit</a> feature. I believe though they just signed up for it because one of their sales representative pushed the feature too <strong>hard</strong>, the brand had too much money to burn and they were just to exhausted with there day to day operations to deliberate on IT decisions. So they let the "experts" chose for them. [<small>And it's quite plain to see how hybris has gone to great lengths to establish their expertise in the market by conducting seminars and publishing papers and doing a PR story on founders struggling to put the idea out when they were just little kinds in college. Standard stuff.</small>]. We won't be taking this approach but there are still some lessons to be learnt on the art of product building/selling. </li>
          <li>The project took 9 months to complete. <small>[9 months? aha!]</small></li>
        <li>40 million unique visitors in 2013. [<small>We should be able to use this
	    number as the test data</small>]</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Features</strong></p>
      <ol>
          <li id="cock">The Customer Service Cockpit pulls customer data together in one place, allowing customer
service agents to serve their clients’ needs regardless of channel. <small>[This can be tied together with our <a href="/study/forums.html#help_desk">forum helpdesk</a> idea, hybris uses this approach by encouraging users to deploy <a href="/study/forums.html#sap_jam">sap jam</a> with their hybris app]</small></li>
