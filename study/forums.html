    <h1>Discourse</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The installation of discourse was simple enough following <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-cloud.md">this guide</a></li>
      <li>But I wanted a discourse env on my local machine so I installed it <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/VAGRANT.md">using this guide</a>. </li>
      <li>Unfortunately though I could not get it to work using vagrant. Twice it failed to download the images. When the images were downloaded it threw up another error "While executing VboxManage". I decided to look for other alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>NodeBB</h1>
    <ul>   
      <li>Fortunately I found another cool forum software called <a href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB">nodebb</a>. It has everything that discourse has plus it's written in node so I don't have to learn a new language in case I want to hack it. Furthermore I really liked it's plugin api so I decided to go with it.</li>
      <li>I can use the nodebb write api to create a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32626908/nodebb-write-api-example-to-create-new-user">new user</a></li>
      <li>It looks like we can activate nodebb plugins via <a href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues/4252">command line</a></li>
      <li>The issue that added command line setup <a href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues/382">script for nodebb</a></li>
      <li>The install directory contains default setup data that can be configured to set different defaults for the type of forum user we are targeting. ex a community of landlords may have different defaults from say a community of college students. </li>
      <li>The default setup with no parameters automatically creates an adminstrative account with a username and a randomly generated password.</li>
      <li>Nodebb requires restart everytime a new plugin is installed or a theme is changed. </li>
      <li id="stat_data">By default nodebb installs with a pre-configured list of topics and categories. These topics and categories are defined statically in the <em>/install/data</em> directory. At the time of installation we should be able to modify the files contained in this directory to create categories and topics specific to our particular audience. For example the categories and topics for a college community forum would be a different as compared to the categories and topics for a boutique hotel helpdesk app.</li>
      <li>Node bb can setup via <a href="https://community.nodebb.org/topic/4325/set-up-nodebb-via-environment-variables/6">environment variables</a>. Once the app is setup it creates a config.json file. If we include a config.json file with the docker image we won't even need to bother with the setup steps.</li>

    <h1>Application architecture of the forum_container</h1>
    <div id="app_arch">
      <p>The <em>forum_container</em> is a git branch which represents  an instance of the docker container spawned from the base image, consisting of the following applications:- </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A redis server</li>
        <li>Nodebb forum running on port number 4567 along with all it's plugins and <em>node_modules</em></li>
        <li>Openresty as the reverse proxy server</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once the container has been initialized all the updates to it will be pulled dynamically from the <em>forum_container</em> branch. Therefore we need to configure our applications to:-</p>
      <p>[we might not need all these steps as <a href="/study/docker.html#dock_swarm">docker swarm</a> could manage rolling updates for us]</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Communicate with the master process. Master process should be able to send instructions to the running application. And the running application must be able to execute it.</li>
        <li>The process of communication must be two ways. The application must also be able to send updates to the master process about it's state.</li>
        <li>Since all the state information will be stored in the git repository we need to configure our app to pull from the branch at runtime, apply the changes and start the server again. Fortunately there are node bindings for <a href="https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit">native git client</a> that should simplify this process a lot.</li>

        <h1>Top Features of zendesk</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Ticketing system</li>
            <li>Knowledge Base</li>
            <li>Community Forums</li>
            <li>Helpdesk Software</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All of these features can be replicated easily by a forum application which is basically just a content management software.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A ticketing system is a forum topic that is accessible only to admins and the person who created the ticket</li>
            <li>A knowledge base is a topic with no replies. Can be pinned (or stickied) possibly.</li>
            <li>Community forums are just vanilla forums</li>
            <li>And helpdesk is #1 and #2 combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To build our own little CRM service all we need to do is focus on theming and the looks of our application and we should be able to sell it to a wide audience. Once we have the basic tools ready we can study the market research done by other providers and build on the base created by them. So there is a huge scope for branching products here and lots of money machines can be spun off from a single core service.</p>
