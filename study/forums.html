    <h1>Discourse</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>The installation of discourse was simple enough following <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-cloud.md">this guide</a></li>
      <li>But I wanted a discourse env on my local machine so I installed it <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/VAGRANT.md">using this guide</a>. </li>
      <li>Unfortunately though I could not get it to work using vagrant. Twice it failed to download the images. When the images were downloaded it threw up another error "While executing VboxManage". Therefore I decided to look for other alternatives.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>NodeBB</h1>
    <ol>
      
      <li>Fortunately I found another cool forum software called <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB">nodebb</a>. It has everything that discourse has plus it's written in node so I don't have to learn a new language in case I want to hack it. Furthermore I really liked it's plugin api so I decided to go with it.</li>
      <li><s>I can use the nodebb write api to create a <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32626908/nodebb-write-api-example-to-create-new-user">new user</a></s>.
        <small>[Who needs an api if you've got <a href="/activity-logs/todo.html#mongo_http">direct access</a> to the database?]</small>
      </li>
      <li>It looks like we can activate nodebb plugins via <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues/4252">command line</a></li>
      <li>The issue that added command line setup <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues/382">script for nodebb</a></li>
      <li>The install directory contains default setup data that can be <a rel="noreferrer" href="#config">configured</a> to set different defaults for the type of forum user we are targeting. ex a community of landlords may have different defaults from say a community of college students. </li>
      <li>The default setup with no parameters automatically creates an administrative account with a username and a randomly generated password.</li>
      <li>Nodebb requires restart everytime a new plugin is installed or a theme is changed. </li>
      <li id="stat_data">By default nodebb installs with a pre-configured list of topics and categories. These topics and categories are defined statically in the <em>/install/data</em> directory. At the time of installation we should be able to modify the files contained in this directory to create categories and topics specific to our particular audience. For example the categories and topics for a college community forum would be a different as compared to the categories and topics for a boutique hotel helpdesk app.</li>
      <li>Node bb can setup via <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://community.nodebb.org/topic/4325/set-up-nodebb-via-environment-variables/6">environment variables</a>. Once the app is setup it creates a config.json file. If we include a config.json file with the docker image we won't even need to bother with the setup steps.</li>
      <li>
	Nodebb can be run on
	<a rel="noreferrer" href="https://nodebb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring/databases/mongo.html">
	  MongoDb
	</a>
        <small>Also look at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/configuration/#run-multiple-database-instances-on-the-same-system"> mongodb configuration</a>, it seems that a single mongodb server can support <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://nodebb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring/databases/mongo.html#step-8-configuring-nodebb">multiple nodebb</a> instances</small>
      </li>
      <li>I don't think that we will ever encounter any <a href="https://community.nodebb.org/topic/3538/scalability-and-responsiveness">scalability problems</a> with nodebb. Especially if we look at some <a href="/study/hotels.html#sc_facts">statistics</a> for the housing industry. We should promptly get rid all doubts from our mind. <small>(At 3 concurrent users we can serve > 2 million views a month, scalability of a single forum should be no problem at all, nginx is also very good at maintaining websocket connections <a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-websockets-performance/?utm_source=websocket-nginx&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=Core+Product">with about 50k sockets</a> being happily connected on a single server with 1gb of ram, what we should be careful about is spikes in usage)</small> </li>

    <h1>Application architecture of the forum_container</h1>
    <div id="app_arch">
      <p>The <em>forum_container</em> is a git branch which represents  an instance of the docker container spawned from the base image, consisting of the following applications:- </p>
      <ol>
        <li><s>A redis server</s> [We'll be using mongodb baby]</li>
        <li>Nodebb forum running on port number 4567 along with all it's plugins and <em>node_modules</em></li>
        <li>Openresty as the reverse proxy server</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once the container has been initialized all the updates to it will be pulled dynamically from the <em>forum_container</em> branch. Therefore we need to configure our applications to:-</p>
      <p>[we might not need all these steps as <a rel="noreferrer" href="/study/docker.html#dock_swarm">docker swarm</a> could manage rolling updates for us]</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Communicate with the master process. Master process should be able to send instructions to the running application. And the running application must be able to execute it.</li>
        <li>The process of communication must be two ways. The application must also be able to send updates to the master process about it's state.</li>
        <li>Since all the state information will be stored in the git repository we need to configure our app to pull from the branch at runtime, apply the changes and start the server again. Fortunately there are node bindings for <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit">native git client</a> that should simplify this process a lot.</li>

        <p>All of these features can be replicated easily by a forum application which is basically just a content management software.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A ticketing system is a forum topic that is accessible only to admins and the person who created the ticket</li>
            <li>A knowledge base is a topic with no replies. Can be pinned (or stickied) possibly.</li>
            <li>Community forums are just vanilla forums</li>
            <li>And helpdesk is #1 and #2 combined.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To build our own little CRM service all we need to do is focus on theming and the looks of our application and we should be able to sell it to a wide audience. Once we have the basic tools ready we can study the market research done by other providers and build on the base created by them. So there is a huge scope for branching products here and lots of money machines can be spun off from a single core service.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="config">
      <h1>The configuration setup</h1>
      <p>To configure nodebb database we'll create on demand files. <s>The configuration data will be stored in mongodb collection belonging to a particular nodebb instance</s>. The configruation setup will be stored in a meta database that will be common across all the services. Before starting nodebb we'll execute a shell script (<a href="/activity-logs/todo.html#q_config"> should be a matter of simple http request</a>) that queries the database and saves the result of configuration in a file. Then nodebb can be started with that configuration. The configuration may be templatized to suit the demands of a particular service instance. The data to render the template will also be stored in the <a href="/activity-logs/todo.html#config_meta">meta database</a>.</p>
      <p>Same technique can be used to replace <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15275599/how-do-i-insert-html-into-mongodb">templates, headers and footers</a> of a particular installation instance.</p>
      <div id="first_run">
        <p><strong>The first run experience</strong></p>
        <p>Basically we need to do two things. Modify the files in the install directory and automate the running of the nodebb script. That's all. For file modification we need to prepare sales copies for different type of client categories.</p>
        <ol>
	  <li>Customize the category names and category descriptions in the install directory. This should be different for each type of client. For example a client in the hospitality sector will have different. Note that even the colors and icons of the categories can be customized. Once more we'll keep the category definitions templatized in mongodb, query it via the http interface, render the data and replace the flies on the client pod. This step must be completed before the installation is complete</li>
          <li>
	    Enable arbitrary uploads in the forum directory
            <small>Use
              <a href="https://minio.io/">minio</a> to provide a lease/document management function for the cloud. It comes with automatic installation guide for kubernetes.
	    </small>
	  </li>

	  <li id="auto_ans"><s> Once the installation setup has been completed.
	      We need a script to provide automatic answers to nodebb command line prompts.
	      This can easily be done with the help of <a href="/study/infrastructure.html#infra_expect">expect</a></s>.
	    We don't actually need expect as we can simply <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14392525/passing-arguments-to-an-interactive-program-non-interactively">redirect</a> the program input from a file. We'll however need to dynamically generate an answers file. But that should be easy.
	  </li>
	  <li>Update the <a href="#update_title">logo and forum title</a> directly in the database once the installation has been completed.
	    The exact data to update the fields with, will be provided from the meta database.
	  </li>
          <li>Modify the welcome text to give all the details of what can be done with the application. The welcome text will be different based on the type of service used by the client. A welcome text for building communities, for example, will be different from the welcome text for running a helpdesk application.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div id="db_struct">
        <p><strong>The database structure</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Nodebb may use websockets to communicate with the app routes (internally defined libraries) so the normal network requests would not show up in the dev tools. Inspect the socket connections to overcome this limitation.</li>
          <li id="update_title">
	    The forum title is contained in the "config" document. All we need to do to change it is
	    update the "title" property.
	    This can be done at run time via the <a href="/activity-logs/todo.html#mongo_http">http api</a>
	    that we've exposed off the mongo db service.
            <small>db.objects.find({_key:"config"}).pretty()</small>
	  </li>
          <li>
	    The config document also allows us to set up the home page screen (meaning the page that comes up when the user first hits the service root endpoint) by setting the
            <small>homePageRoute</small> property.
	  </li>
          <li>Custom headers (including links to scripts and css files) maybe added with the "customJS" and "useCustomJS" keys in the config document of the object collection.</li>
          <li>Skins can be changed without recompiling. In the config collection the skin is represented by "bootswatchSkin" key.</li>
          <li>
	    The social visibility of the posts can be configured by the social:posts.activated key.
            <small>db.objects.find({_key:"social:posts.activated"}).pretty()</small>
	  </li>
          <li>
	    Global headers and footers are stored in the "global:widgets" key
	    <small>db.objects.find(_key:"widgets:global")</small>
	  </li>
          <li>
	    Other widgets can be found using
            <small>db.objects.find({_key:/widgets.*/}).pretty()</small>
	    Even if they are not present we may create them to customize the first run experience. The app will take care of finding and updating them later on should the client request to do that. The formatting is also taken care of for us.
