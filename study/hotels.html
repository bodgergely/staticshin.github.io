    <p id="pricing"><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
    <p>Our goal is to build multiple streams of income so that we don't have to rely on any one idea to succeed [<a rel="noreferrer" href="#why_pricing">why?</a>]. At the same time we are resource constrained and can't work productively on completely different themes. Therefore as a compromise we need to think of ways in which we can earn money by spinning our features into standalone/whitelabel services.</p>
    <p>For example:-</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If we are building a hosted booking engine can we provide customized integrations with existing website for a one time fee?</li>
      <li>If we are adding a discussion forum on our website can we provide a hosted whitelabel forum that can be integrated with a clients website for a fee? </li>
      <li>If we are building a chat widget, can we sell that widget to other property websites?</li>
      <li>Can we outsource our analytics engine to other people in hospitality sector? [This sounds like a brilliant idea if I may say so myself :P]</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The idea is that if we've built an expertise around a product or a service (while working on it during the development of our own product) we must look for ways where we can cash that expertise.</p>
    <p>These services don't have to be marketed to different targets. The same set of audience can be sold different products based on their needs. We may also consider building customized services for them if the time investment is not that great. Depending upon the situation we may take a decision to accept clients who are not from our target audience.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fixed price Per Booking</li>
      <li>Fixed price Per Day of use </li>
      <li>Fixed price according to No of rental properties managed</li>
      <li>Fixed monthly fee</li>
      <li>Fees based on usage criteria ex $1 per 100 support requests via chat, $1 per 1000 hits on website. If none of these criteria are fulfilled we charge the user nothing. </li>
      <li>Inventory management fees (based on number of listings the user has) such that if the user inventory is booked via our website we charge a fixed fee. </li>
      <li>Provide custom hosting for discussion forums. We should be able to provide a while label discourse to help tour operators/people running popular travel blogs increase their engagement with their audience. It could be another stream of income. </li>
    </ol>
    <div id="why_pricing">** Because a failure with any one idea means total failure. We don't want that. Furthermore we need to get the money in as soon as possible. With a product it may take a while before we start seeing any revenue,however with services we may be able to get more clients. Furthermore following this approach it is quite possible that we can build an audience that refers us to other people who may in turn become clients of our main application. </div>

    <p>[We need to do more research in the education tourism sector]</p>
    <p><strong>Rented property portfolio for investors</strong> [Suggestion]</p>
    <p>It is common knowledge that landlords invest in properties to expand their portfolio. Buying of properties require a large amount of capital upfront and it's usually a long time before the returns come in. Buying a property is essentially a long term investment.</p>
    <p>However airbnb has created a different kind of investment market. That of of "rentalpreneurs". There are people who rent various apartments only to sublet them on airbnb. Now subletting is looked down upon by various landlords, they want to feel in control of their property even when it's rented out. Subletting to some extent takes away that control from them.</p>
    <p>To overcome this objection we can build a system that allows the landlords to "virtually lease" their property to investors for a period of say 6 months or an year. The lessee would then be free to recover his investment by letting out the property to other tenants and the landlord would have a guaranteed long term income.</p>
    <p>The crucial difference is that while airbnb encourages deceit which results in bad blood between landlords and tenants, there is no such issue here. The landlord is promised an occupancy rate of 100% for the duration of the lease. He won't have to manage the property, he won't have to care about generating leads for his accommodation. He gets his fixed income and then he can go to a vacation in Malta or some other place. Where as the property investor gets to invest a smaller sum with much quicker returns. The lease may be renewed if the parties are happy with the partnership. Win win.</p>
    <p><strong>Analytics for users</strong></p>
    <div>
      <p>We can use google anaytics  to track the webstes <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">across multiple domains and subdomains</a>. We can also pull results using the analytics api for every domain/subdomain. </p>
      <p>There is a <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">node js</a> client library for GA. Bindings are also available in <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/libraries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">other languages</a></p>
      <p>We should also provide simplified analytics summary for the users. The summary should be visible on a separate screen in the mobile app. Some ideas on parameters that can be tracked:-  </p>
      <ul>
	<li>From which countries he gets visits. He should be able to see the country name and the number of visitors he got from that country. Ex: India: 203</li>
	<li>Number of hits per month </li>
	<li>Number of chat requests</li>
	<li>Number of bookings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending upon the success of the analytics feature we may also add other parameters to track:- </p>
      <ul>
	<li>On what listings he got most hits</li>
	<li>From what country/region he got his most bookings</li>
	<li>How is property doing with respect to other users in the same area?</li>
	<li>On what days he got overbooked?</li>
	<li>On what days the bookings got cancelled?</li>
	<li>What's the occupancy rate for his property? </li>
	<li>What % of people who booked actually showed up? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on the numbers we may also provide him tips on maximizing his occupancy rate.  Or at least encourage him to talk of the discussion forums so that he may get help from the community. </p>

      <p id="q_a"><strong>Q's and A's</strong></p>
      <p>1. <em>What are we building?</em></p>
      <p>A: We are building an application that allows property managers to manage and promote their properties. </p>
      <p>2. <em>Who will use it?</em></p>
      <p>A: The term "property managers" is pretty broad, there are many different kinds properties focused on serving different segments of the market. Initially we'll be focusing on short term accommodation sector. That means our clients will be vacation home owners, shack owners, people with boutique hotels etc</p>
      <p>3. <em>Why are we building it?</em></p>
      <p>A: Because we can? Our target market is really  big with 148.3M bookings being made online every year. There is no way to effectively determine how many accommodation providers are there in the world but it's very easy to see that they have to deal with multiple applications each takcling a very limited subset of the problem. If we can make a product that serves as a sort of mini command center and allows them to work on various aspects of their property from a single app we've got ourselves a business.</p>
      <p>4. <em>How is it different from existing solutions?</em></p>
      <p>Ok so this will be a lengthy answer. When we say that we're building an app for home owners that helps them manage their property we are implying that the properties of our customers are being used to make money. And they are making money by renting/leasing their properties. Which means that they have found a market for their homes.Now this is where it gets tricky.</p>
      <p>Ideally the channel that brings them customers should also provide them with tools to manage their property. Because they already control a very large part of their operation. But since that is not the case with the channels we have to build an application that not only allows the owners to manage their property but also doubles up as a lead generation platform. </p>
      <p>So we have to think about this app from two different perspectives. From the perspective of home owner the application should function as a tool that manages their bookings, their dealings with the guests. From the perspective of the guests the application should allow then to search for home, talk with their owners, pay for their booking online etc.</p>
      <p>It is different from the existing applications in the market because it provides a solution to twin aspects of managing and selling a property. We have a lot of listing websites but those websites are not very good individualizing a customers offering (a home is just one among the thousand others) and do not provide any solution to the day to day problems faced while running a rental business (invoicing,billing,marketing, keeping records of tenants etc).  </p>
      <p>5. <em>What is the MVP?</em></p>
      <p>A: The MVP is a forum application that can serve as a communication tool (a help desk) for the internal/external operations of a property. The idea is that we can go to a boutique hotel and ask sell them a tool that allows them to not only communicate with their prospective customers but also with other members of their team. </p>
      <p>We are going to re-purpose nodebb, an opensource forum and distribute it as a helpdesk software to our target audience (boutique hotels, vacation rental owners). In the background we'll be building our main application and once it's ready we'll start communication process by first reaching out to our forum audience and then take it further from there.</p>
      <p>The MVP can also be sold to people who are not directly our target audience but can indirectly influence the success of our app. For ex if we sell the forum software to college communities the students can help us promote our property management app when they go on a vacation. Or maybe to someone who owns a vacation rental. Even in the case they make no such promotion or introduction we still gain an audience that can benefit our home owners that are already on our platform. That is we can start bringing our existing property owners some customers that we gain from our forums to stay in their homes. </p>
      <p>Moreover this MVP gives us an opportunity to build our server technology. When we are first launching an app we need to do a lot of ground work like provisioning our server, setting up development and production environments ,setting up a testing framework and so on. Since the development task is a bit light (thanks to the opensource app) we can focus our efforts in secondary activities that will help us speed up the execution of our main application.</p>

      <p>6. <em>Where is the MVP?</em></p>
      <p>Safe in a git repository far away from the clutches of this evil world, where it continues to patiently await it's evolution into a pretty butterfly ready to scintillate it's splendour upon one and all. </p>

        <div id="cbed">
	  <p>Cloudbeds was started by a team of engineers who built lots of tools for people in the hospitality domain. PMS, CRMs and channel managers. After doing this for sometime they found a market where an <strong>integration of these tools</strong> on a single platform could be sold. The idea was that it would simplify the hotel management for owners and staff. The important thing from my point of view is that they came to the same conclusion that I did and made</p>
          <ol>
              <li>A PMS</li>
              <li>A channel manager</li>
              <li>A CRM</li>
          </ol>
          <p>on a single platform.</p>
          <p>My approach is just a bit different from them. I start with the CRM. By morphing the <a rel="noreferrer" href="/study/forums.html#feat_list">forum application</a> to serve as an internal communication tool for project management. And then build a booking engine on top of it.</p>
