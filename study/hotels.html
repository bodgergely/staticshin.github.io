    <ul>
      <li>Find people from stackexchange travel board, use api to automate information gathering.
      </li>
      <li>Collect information from airbnb and couchsurfing profile pages.
      </li>
      <li>Start a discourse discussion board to provide travel related information. 
      </li>
      <li>Re-purpose the marketing data gathered from various sources and make it freely available  as a lookup search engine that can be used by the travelers/researchers to study their host/ the property. Other booking websites are not quite good at this. Think of it as a content discovery platform, something that will keep the travelers coming back and increase our app engagement.

    <p id="pricing"><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
    <p>Our goal is to build multiple streams of income so that we don't have to rely on any one idea to succeed [<a href="#why_pricing">why?</a>]. At the same time we are resource constrained and can't work productively on completely different themes. Therefore as a compromise we need to think of ways in which we can earn money by spinning our features into standalone/whitelabel services.</p>
    <p>For example:-</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If we are building a hosted booking engine can we provide customized integrations with existing website for a one time fee?</li>
        <li>If we are adding a discussion forum on our website can we provide a hosted whitelabel forum that can be integrated with a clients website for a fee? </li>
        <li>If we are building a chat widget, can we sell that widget to other property websites?</li>
        <li>Can we outsource our analytics engine to other people in hospitality sector? [This sounds like a brilliant idea if I may say so myself :P]</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The idea is that if we've built an expertise around a product or a service (while working on it during the development of our own product) we must look for ways where we can cash that expertise.</p>
    <p>These services don't have to be marketed to different targets. The same set of audience can be sold different products based on their needs. We may also consider building customized services for them if the time investment is not that great. Depending upon the situation we may take a decision to accept clients who are not from our target audience.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fixed price Per Booking</li>
      <li>Fixed price Per Day of use </li>
      <li>Fixed price according to No of rental properties managed</li>
      <li>Fixed monthly fee</li>
      <li>Fees based on usage criteria ex $1 per 100 support requests via chat, $1 per 1000 hits on website. If none of these criteria are fulfilled we charge the user nothing. </li>
      <li>Inventory management fees (based on number of listings the user has) such that if the user inventory is booked via our website we charge a fixed fee. </li>
      <li>Provide custom hosting for discussion forums. We should be able to provide a while label discourse to help tour operators/people running popular travel blogs increase their engagement with their audience. It could be another stream of income. </li>
    </ol>
    <div id="why_pricing">** Because a failure with any one idea means total failure. We don't want that. Furthermore we need to get the money in as soon as possible. With a product it may take a while before we start seeing any revenue,however with services we may be able to get more clients. Furthermore following this approach it is quite possible that we can build an audience that refers us to other people who may in turn become clients of our main application. </div>

    <p><strong>Rented property portfolio for investors</strong> [Suggestion]</p>
    <p>It is common knowledge that landlords invest in properties to expand their portfolio. Buying of properties require a large amount of capital upfront and it's usually a long time before the returns come in. Buying a property is essentially a long term investment.</p>
    <p>However airbnb has created a different kind of investment market. That of of "rentalpreneurs". There are people who rent various apartments only to sublet them on airbnb. Now subletting is looked down upon by various landlords, they want to feel in control of their property even when it's rented out. Subletting to some extent takes away that control from them.</p>
    <p>To overcome this objection we can build a system that allows the landlords to "virtually lease" their property to investors for a period of say 6 months or an year. The lessee would then be free to recover his investment by letting out the property to other tenants and the landlord would have a guaranteed long term income.</p>
    <p>The crucial difference is that while airbnb encourages deceit which results in bad blood between landlords and tenants, there is no such issue here. The landlord is promised an occupancy rate of 100% for the duration of the lease. He won't have to manage the property, he won't have to care about generating leads for his accommodation. He gets his fixed income and then he can go to a vacation in Malta or some other place. Where as the property investor gets to invest a smaller sum with much quicker returns. The lease may be renewed if the parties are happy with the partnership. Win win.</p>
    <p><strong>Analytics for users</strong></p>
    <div>
      <p>We can use google anaytics  to track the webstes <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">across multiple domains and subdomains</a>. We can also pull results using the analytics api for every domain/subdomain. </p>
      <p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/google/google-api-nodejs-client/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">node js</a> client library for GA. Bindings are also available in <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/libraries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">other languages</a></p>
      <p>We should also provide simplified analytics summary for the users. The summary should be visible on a separate screen in the mobile app. Some ideas on parameters that can be tracked:-  </p>
      <ul>
	<li>From which countries he gets visits. He should be able to see the country name and the number of visitors he got from that country. Ex: India: 203</li>
	<li>Number of hits per month </li>
	<li>Number of chat requests</li>
	<li>Number of bookings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending upon the success of the analytics feature we may also add other parameters to track:- </p>
      <ul>
	<li>On what listings he got most hits</li>
	<li>From what country/region he got his most bookings</li>
	<li>How is property doing with respect to other users in the same area?</li>
	<li>On what days he got overbooked?</li>
	<li>On what days the bookings got cancelled?</li>
	<li>What's the occupancy rate for his property? </li>
	<li>What % of people who booked actually showed up? </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on the numbers we may also provide him tips on maximizing his occupancy rate.  Or at least encourage him to talk of the discussion forums so that he may get help from the community. </p>
