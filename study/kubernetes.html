    <h1>Kubernetes</h1>
    <p>It seems that Kubernetes is a "platform independent" (it works with docker as well as rkt) container management tool. Among other things it allows me to perform updates to running containers. This greatly simplifies my work as I won't have to build my own <a rel="noreferrer" href="/study/docker.html#prop_updates">update propagation</a> chain.  </p>
    <p id="docker_swarm"><s>However most of the features that I need from kubernetes are also available natively in docker swarm. So I will be sticking to that.</s>
      <small>[There are other things to <a rel="noreferrer" href="#consider_this">consider</a>]</small>
    </p>
    <p id="consider_this">One point about kubernetes that I hadn't considered before was that it allows me to run my app in a managed google container engine environment. Which means that I can provision on demand servers from google itself and the servers I provision this way will be automatically added as a node in my kubernetes cluster. If I <a rel="noreferrer" href="#docker_swarm">go with docker swarm</a> I'm on my own and I'll have to manage and deploy vps by writing programs. This will make my job harder. Amazon does offer an <a rel="noreferrer" href="/study/infrastructure.html#ecs">elastic container service</a> that allows you to do something similar, but that is very costly because first it forces me to use multiple amazon services and second it locks me in (since the services you rely on to provision containers are proprietary amazon services). And besides, Google container engine comes out to be much cheaper overall even if you consider only the prices of compute engines vs the price of ec2 servers .Therefore I'm looking into kubernetes again.</p>
    <p>Kubernetes instead of deploying containers directly works with an abstraction of pods. A pod may contain one or more containers which run in a shared context within the same node. All the containers within a pod are networked with each other.</p>
    <p>It is important to remember that in the dev mode minikube assigns the ip address to our virtual node. So that to get the ip address we must use the built in command <small>sudo minikube service $service_name --url

    <div id="scale_replica">
      <p><strong>A word on scaling and replicas</strong></p>

      <p>Scaling in kubernetes refers to increasing/decreasing the number of replicas in the deployment. Now replication of has been a bit difficult for me to understand. What I want to achieve is ability to run multiple instances of an app. Now this comes quite close to what replication does but it does not solve my problem. Why?
        <small>[Maybe we could look into <a rel="noreferrer" href="#headless">headless</a> services]</small>
      </p>
      <p>Because kubernetes distributes traffic automatically among all the available pods. While it's good for scaling the app and distributing traffic this is not what I want. Instead I need a node to host pods for a particular client. So it's more like multiple nodes and each of the node having multiple pods (which refer to the services used by a client). A <a rel="noreferrer" href="#analogy">helpful analogy<a rel="noreferrer"/>.</p>
      <p><strong>A word on rolling updates</strong></p>
      <p>Kubernetes performs rolling updates by creating new pods with an image description and then terminating the existing pods. This raises two important implications for our architecture:- </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Since we are designing one service pod per node architecture we need to plan for unavailability/maintenance of apps</li>
        <li>
	  It would be best if app containers could simply update themselves via a <a rel="noreferrer" href="/study/docker.html#prop_updates">git repo</a> the same idea which we considered with docker.
	</li>
        <li>I can't think of a scenario in production where rollback would be useful. The update is so heavy with creation and deletion of pods that if I ever take the plunge to update I'll make sure that I won't have to roll back under any circumstance.</li>
      </ol>

    <p>To access the kubernetes dashboard on the browser start kubernetes proxy (this will manages certificate on the behalf of the browser) and point the browser to <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/">http://localhost:8001/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/</a></p>
    <div id="analogy">
      <h1>Analogy</h1>
      <p><s>Consider a building. Each building has multiple apartments. A tenant owns an apartment and he may have his stuff within that apartment. The way I'm seeing things right now is :- Kubernetes master is the building. A node is an apartment and pods is all the stuff in the apartment. I need to create apartments for my customers.</s></p>
      <p><s>Since each apartment or node will be a physical server I'll have to be very careful about what <a rel="noreferrer" href="/study/infrastructure.html">infrastructure provider</a> I use</s>. <small>[There is a much  better way to <a rel="noreferrer" href="#arch">  architect this</a>]</small> We need to keep the costs of provisioning and monitoring new nodes as low as possible. With this point in mind <a rel="noreferrer" href="#consider_this">Amazon ECS</a> looks pretty expensive to me.</p>
      <div id="arch">
	<strong>A better architechture</strong>
        <p>There is a much better way to implement what we are trying to do. Rather than considering nodes as the apartments, we can consider a node as a building, a pod as an apartment and containers as the objects in the apartment. With this analogy we can create a single pod for database. Multiple pods for application instances. The database pod may be moved to a different node. The application instances may also be moved if they get too resource hungry.</p>
        <p>For a client with higher resrouce requirements we may consider to provision a sperate node and deploy the database and application pods on it. However we must keep in mind that node updates are a bit complex and we need to setup automatic  backups of the database. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div id="headless">
      <p><strong>A headless service</strong></p>
      <p>Kubernetes has a concept of "headless" services in which it does not configure any load balancing. These services will still have dns records and they can be accessed via IP addresses but if such services are to be <a rel="noreferrer" href="#scale_replica">scaled</a> then mechanism then the burden of writing a discovery pattern is upon us. In other words headless services allow you to use kubernetes without load balancing.</p>
      <p>This has one very obvious implication for us. A replica for a load balanced pod functions as a single service.Eg:- lets say an nginx pod has two replicas a request coming in to kubernetes system would by dynamically assigned to one of the two instances.</p>
      <p>Where as if there are replicas in a headless system thy will not be load balanced for us and we can simply route the url to the pod of our choosing. Which means we can create replica pods for clients using similar kind of services and then route the incoming traffic to a particular pod ip address. </p>
