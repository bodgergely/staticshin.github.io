    <h1>Prep for marketing</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>One of the chief arguments against wp seems to be that it is difficult to set up and the wide variety of options make it actually hard for a novice user to gain anything useful out of it. In a comparison video with squarespace it was made clear by the critic that <a href="#item1">setting up</a> your own wordpress infrastructure is painful even if you can do more things with it at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I need a content generation strategy.Why? Because No matter how hard I try I won't be able to create effective content all on my own. I can only do a certain amount of things in a day. Writing a post will take 2-3 hours at least and that is after I have done all the research. Besides that I'm not an expert in this industry so it is quite possible that the topics I choose and the posts that I write turn out to be bland. So I'm thinking of inviting users (pros in this field) for guest posts. I will give them a theme to write upon, a couple of questions that set the tone for the article. The questions will be constructed so that the audience not only has a good idea about the author does but also why he does it and how he does it. What I'm trying to do will be a mix of an interview and free-form writing. The questions will give the author a context to write in but he won't be constrained by the questions and can even ignore them entirely if he so chooses. With this strategy I hope I can create a win-win situation for everybody:-
        <ol>
            <li>The author of the post gets a free advertisement on our website</li>
            <li>The audience get an engaging content to read</li>
            <li>I get content to market and  an ambassador to help me market it</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The other thing is to chose the people to write content on our website. For that I need to tap into my twitter account (its a good thing that I've been active over there and have a decent number of people to reach out to on day 1). This is quite obvious. However there is another thing that I can do and that is to actively reach out to bloggers and other influencers in the industry and prospects who are not on twitter. People who have their own marketing agencies, for example (in my domain) should be quite happy to partner with me on this. Later on these people can become the most obvious choice to market my app to. Maybe some of them will even become the first customers. I need to go for the win win here.</li>
    </ol>
    <div id="action_items">
      <h1>Actionable items</h1>
      
      <ol>
        <li id="item1">We must make app features easy to use for our audience. Depending upon the type of customer we get the admin panel must be fine tuned to make everything seem natural to him. But before that happens we must be able to communicate the ease of use through our website. Which means that we should show some finished products. A few sample stores/websites for rentals maybe? So that there can be an example in front of the user that someone else has done it before, so I can do it too.</li>
        <li id="item2">
	  So the <a href="#big_comm_anal"> analysis</a> big commerce website gives me one actionable insight which is that we should focus on increasing the business for our customer and reduce the comparative cost of running his business on other platforms. Given our target domain of travel and tourism this increase in business might be a bit difficult to achieve, however we can most certainly reduce the running costs. But let's not get ahead of ourselves and address these issues one by one. Baby steps.
	</li>
        <li id="item3">
	  Show the customer that our application is reliable, and that we are on their side. We want to make money on mutually agreeable terms. Give them tools to migrate their own websites to a hosting provider of their choice at no cost.
          <small>This feature might be a bit costly to develop and it would require me to be familiar with the intricacies of the architecture but as I become familiar with it I should be able to build capabilities that make it easier for me. This will definitely not be a day 1 feature.

      <ol>
        <li>MFH operators are very hard to reach. These people are laggards when it comes to technology. Their core business does not depend much on investing in new tools so they use the same old cruft developed in the dark ages. From their point of view they have no need to upgrade  to something that is just "easier to use". It is impossible to reach a  portfolio owner directly. And even if I could reach them it is impossible to convince them to use our application? Why? Because they are used to enterprisey sales. You need to schedule multiple meetings with them. Give them presentations, buy them gifts, wish them a happy new year and then if they are in a generous mood they might deign to test the application in a live environment. Now a lot of people have made money selling to these types of clients but it will not be a good idea for me to go after them directly. What I should be doing is to target other businesses that have cropped around a big business like real estate and sell them our services. </li>
        <li>To give an example:- A big real estate company has hundreds of assets under its management. It can't do all of the management work on its own so it has to rely on third party services like an agency of property managers or an IT staff that they can outsource to. I need to target such third parties that already work with big portfolio owners and sell them my products that they can use to service their own clients. Although I have some experience with the <a href="/study/forums.html#sp_prop_man">needs of these people</a> I need to collect more in depth data so I can tune my pitch for them.</li>
        <li>Given that this is a very difficult to market segment but quite prosperous one I need to answer a few questions before I can develop an effective strategy for them:-
           <ol>
               <li>In the day and age of airbnb, where individual home owners have more reach than big portfolio names, how do they plan to use new marketing technologies to reach to more prospects? Do they even need to?</li>
               <li>For property owners with a range of properties across the world how do they plan to create and maintain a single online portfolio? Do they even consider this point?</li>
               <li>Would they benefit from a single platform that </li>
           </ol>
	   I can feel that some of these questions are quite weak. To be able to sell to this segment I need to make my proposition a lot sweeter (for them) So for now I will take a break from this market and focus on the low hanging fruits (ah the phrase takes me <a href="/activity-logs/index.html#barclays_low_hanging">back</a>!)

    </div>
    <div id="ajio">
      <h1>Ajio</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Reliance online fashion store</li>
        <li>Slogan: Doubt is out</li>
        <li>Ajio won great applause for mixing social activism with its fashion business debuting with "real life models" dressed in their collections. They debuted on Lakme fashion show with to promote fearless fashion that cuts though all mental blocks of age,gender, identity,size etc. This campaign was meant to portray ajio as the brand ambassador of "living life to the fullest" philosophy.</li>
        <li>Like most other ecommerce stores their twitter account is full
	  of advertisements for their merchandise and events. One thing however that is noticeably absent is the presence of a blog. Given their philosophy of doubt is out one would think that they would write tonnes and tonnes of content about inspiring men and women who have lived life fearlessly. Maybe get some of these people to promote their brand as well but this hasn't happened (yet).</li>
        <li>They boast of having a collection of handpicked items. That is not every item makes it to the ajio store. It is carefully vetted by their team to ensure top quality for their customers. This is ajio's way of distinguishing itself from a free marketplace like amazon where quality control is left mostly to consumer reviews. Ajio takes this mental burden of "quality control" off the shoulders of the customer. If you buy from Ajio you can be assured of the quality of the product.
	</li>
        <li> I really like Ajio's landing page. It's very clean and features a couple of items from and discounts in a category that the user can select to get started. If you're looking for anything particular you can use always use the search button or jump to a particular category using the menu. It is 100 times better than other ecommerce websites that bombard with lines and lines of product from every available category. No wonder they yap about the poor performance of sql joins.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="mailchimp">
      <h1>Mailchimp</h1>
      <ol> 
        <li>An year ago Mailchimp  "pivoted" from an email newsleteter application to a service that helps it's customers "Build their brand and sell more stuff". I remember the backlash that they faced on hackernews and other places when they announced their decision but I never found any reading material that considered the move from their point of view. So the question that I'll try to investigate here is:- why  an extremely successful email automation company would want move into an e-commerce space? Surely there must be some very compelling reasons.
	</li>
        <li>Looking at their pricing, the free tier is unchanged. They still offer 12K emails per month for 2k subscribers. In the paid plans they have added features like customer segmentation that allows their customers to sell products to a particular demographic. To further demonstrate their ecommerce prowess they advertise features like the ability to follow up after purchases, send triggers on shopping events using their ecommerce ready api and a tight integration with popular ecommerce platforms like shopify and magento. </li>
        <li>Although they offer an api to automate the reach for online sellers my gut says that the UI based rules would be far more popular. I feel that it's a very bad investment to write code for a third party service/api that can be changed at the drop of a hat.</li>
        <li>Social marketing features like selling on facebook and instagram also sound appealing but my objection remains the same. A small business owner bets on <a href="#item3">reliability</a>. His business is his livelihood. With these big companies things change, frequently. So if I base my ecommerce business to sell excursively on facebook/twitter/what not and if they suddenly say "oh this third party selling thing is not working out for us we'll have to close the shop sorry kind fellow" I'll be left stranded. Although this objection is mostly pointless in the context of mailchimp for the moment because they only give you tools to make ads, however its not too improbable to consider that facebook and twitter will add a "shopping cart" someday in their features list and allow users to sell products directly from their website. How would mailchimp or online stores evolve then?</li>
        <li>On the other hand social media is a great place to increase your outreach. Build an audience. Interact with your fans online but sell in your own shop, not in theirs. </li>
        <li>Overall I feel that it is still the old mailchimp that I knew. It is not exactly an ecommerce company, it's only the copy that has been changed to attract new kinds of customers. Maybe because email marketing services are popping out left right and center so they have to do something to differentiate themselves. I'm sure there would have been a lot of changes to their product and code as well but I'm most happy to discover that, the universal favorite ancient monkey instinct, that we all love so much is still intact. On that note I think it would be appropriate for me to sign off and eat a banana.</li>

        <li>Their landing page highlights how the customers of big commerce grow YOY, the uptime of their platform and the cost reductions for running on their servers. "Grow your business" is a main theme of their advertising. Since mobile phones are the current big thing they emphasize the mobile phone conversion rates. </li>
