    <h1>Prep for marketing</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>One of the chief arguments against wp seems to be that it is difficult to set up and the wide variety of options make it actually hard for a novice user to gain anything useful out of it. In a comparison video with squarespace it was made clear by the critic that <a href="#item1">setting up</a> your own wordpress infrastructure is painful even if you can do more things with it at the end of the day.</li>
    </ol>
    <div id="action_items">
      <h1>Actionable items</h1>
      
      <ol>
        <li id="item1">We must make wp features easy to use for our audience. Depending upon the type of customer we get the admin panel must be fine tuned to make everything seem natural to him. But before that happens we must be able to communicate the ease of use through our website. Which means that we should show some finished products. A few sample stores/websites for rentals maybe? So that there can be an example in front of the user that someone else has done it before, so I can do it too.</li>
