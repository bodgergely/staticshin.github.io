    <h1>Prep for marketing</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>One of the chief arguments against wp seems to be that it is difficult to set up and the wide variety of options make it actually hard for a novice user to gain anything useful out of it. In a comparison video with squarespace it was made clear by the critic that <a href="#item1">setting up</a> your own wordpress infrastructure is painful even if you can do more things with it at the end of the day.</li>
    </ol>
    <div id="action_items">
      <h1>Actionable items</h1>
      
      <ol>
        <li id="item1">We must make app features easy to use for our audience. Depending upon the type of customer we get the admin panel must be fine tuned to make everything seem natural to him. But before that happens we must be able to communicate the ease of use through our website. Which means that we should show some finished products. A few sample stores/websites for rentals maybe? So that there can be an example in front of the user that someone else has done it before, so I can do it too.</li>
        <li id="item2">
	  So the <a href="#big_comm_anal"> analysis</a> big commerce website gives me one actionable insight which is that we should focus on increasing the business for our customer and reduce the comparative cost of running his business on other platforms. Given our target domain of travel and tourism this increase in business might be a bit difficult to achieve, however we can most certainly reduce the running costs. But let's not get ahead of ourselves and address these issues one by one. Baby steps.
	</li>
        <li id="item3">
	  Show the customer that our application is reliable, and that we are on their side. We want to make money on mutually agreeable terms. Give them tools to migrate their own websites to a hosting provider of their choice at no cost.
          <small>This feature might be a bit costly to develop and it would require me to be familiar with the intricacies of the architecture but as I become familiar with it I should be able to build capabilities that make it easier for me. This will definitely not be a day 1 feature.

    <div id="ajio">
      <h1>Ajio</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Reliance online fashion store</li>
        <li>Slogan: Doubt is out</li>
        <li>Ajio won great applause for mixing social activism with its fashion business debuting with "real life models" dressed in their collections. They debuted on Lakme fashion show with to promote fearless fashion that cuts though all mental blocks of age,gender, identity,size etc. This campaign was meant to portray ajio as the brand ambassador of "living life to the fullest" philosophy.</li>
        <li>Like most other ecommerce stores their twitter account is full
	  of advertisements for their merchandise and events. One thing however that is noticeably absent is the presence of a blog. Given their philosophy of doubt is out one would think that they would write tonnes and tonnes of content about inspiring men and women who have lived life fearlessly. Maybe get some of these people to promote their brand as well but this hasn't happened (yet).</li>
        <li>They boast of having a collection of handpicked items. That is not every item makes it to the ajio store. It is carefully vetted by their team to ensure top quality for their customers. This is ajio's way of distinguishing itself from a free marketplace like amazon where quality control is left mostly to consumer reviews. Ajio takes this mental burden of "quality control" off the shoulders of the customer. If you buy from Ajio you can be assured of the quality of the product.
	</li>
        <li> I really like Ajio's landing page. It's very clean and features a couple of items from and discounts in a category that the user can select to get started. If you're looking for anything particular you can use always use the search button or jump to a particular category using the menu. It is 100 times better than other ecommerce websites that bombard with lines and lines of product from every available category. No wonder they yap about the poor performance of sql joins.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="mailchimp">
      <h1>Mailchimp</h1>
      <ol> 
        <li>An year ago Mailchimp  "pivoted" from an email newsleteter application to a service that helps it's customers "Build their brand and sell more stuff". I remember the backlash that they faced on hackernews and other places when they announced their decision but I never found any reading material that considered the move from their point of view. So the question that I'll try to investigate here is:- why  an extremely successful email automation company would want move into an e-commerce space? Surely there must be some very compelling reasons.
	</li>
        <li>Looking at their pricing, the free tier is unchanged. They still offer 12K emails per month for 2k subscribers. In the paid plans they have added features like customer segmentation that allows their customers to sell products to a particular demographic. To further demonstrate their ecommerce prowess they advertise features like the ability to follow up after purchases, send triggers on shopping events using their ecommerce ready api and a tight integration with popular ecommerce platforms like shopify and magento. </li>
        <li>Although they offer an api to automate the reach for online sellers my gut says that the UI based rules would be far more popular. I feel that it's a very bad investment to write code for a third party service/api that can be changed at the drop of a hat.</li>
        <li>Social marketing features like selling on facebook and instagram also sound appealing but my objection remains the same. A small business owner bets on <a href="#item3">reliability</a>. His business is his livelihood. With these big companies things change, frequently. So if I base my ecommerce business to sell excursively on facebook/twitter/what not and if they suddenly say "oh this third party selling thing is not working out for us we'll have to close the shop sorry kind fellow" I'll be left stranded. Although this objection is mostly pointless in the context of mailchimp for the moment because they only give you tools to make ads, however its not too improbable to consider that facebook and twitter will add a "shopping cart" someday in their features list and allow users to sell products directly from their website. How would mailchimp or online stores evolve then?</li>
        <li>On the other hand social media is a great place to increase your outreach. Build an audience. Interact with your fans online but sell in your own shop, not in theirs. </li>
        <li>Overall I feel that it is still the old mailchimp that I knew. It is not exactly an ecommerce company, it's only the copy that has been changed to attract new kinds of customers. Maybe because email marketing services are popping out left right and center so they have to do something to differentiate themselves. I'm sure there would have been a lot of changes to their product and code as well but I'm most happy to discover that, the universal favorite ancient monkey instinct, that we all love so much is still intact. On that note I think it would be appropriate for me to sign off and eat a banana.</li>

      <h1><a href="/study/ecommerce.html#big_comm">Bigcommerce</a></h1>
      <ol id="big_comm_anal">
        <li>They have a white background landing page with lots of images (mostly of the stores that run on the big commerce platform). The entire website is peppered with round, blue CTA buttons to make the user somehow click.</li>
        <li>Title: Ecommerce software and shopping cart platform (sounds very generic to me but I guess they would have tested a few different headlines and settled on the one that lead to most conversions)</li>
        <li>Their landing page highlights how the customers of big commerce grow YOY, the uptime of their platform and the cost reductions for running on their servers. "Grow your business" is a main theme of their advertising. Since mobile phones are the current big thing they emphasize the mobile phone conversion rates. </li>
        <li>
	  In a twist they also advertise their ebay integration by spinning it to say
	  "sell to 165 Million ebay customers"
