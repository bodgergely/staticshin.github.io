    <p><strong>Muddha Development notes</strong></p>
    <p>Muddha is a content management system that can be morphed to serve different use cases. A single codebase can be used as a blogging engine a booking platform or an ecommerce application. The core application is lightweight with its entire runtime fitting in <1 mb of ram which allows it to be highly spawnable (you can use one muddha each for your customers on a single production dev). Muddha comes with a large number of compiled themes that can be used to give a unique look to each running muddha. It comes integrated with paypal for payments (there may be support for more payment gateways in the future) ATM it does not handle shipping and taxes but that may change as well in the future.</p>
