    <p><strong>Muddha Development notes</strong></p>
    <p>
      Muddha is a content management system that can be morphed to serve different use cases. A single codebase can be used as a blogging engine a booking platform or an ecommerce application. The core application is lightweight with its entire runtime fitting in <1 mb of ram which allows it to be highly spawnable (you can use one muddha each for your customers on a single production dev). Muddha comes with a large number of compiled themes that can be used to give a unique look to each running muddha. It comes integrated with paypal for payments (<s>there may be support for more payment gateways in the future</s> We'll be using kill bill so there will be many payment gateways integrated from the start, and adding new payment gateways would be as simple as writing a plugin with ruby, yes we'll have to learn ruby but it'll be worth it because it solves a huge pain. )ATM it does not handle shipping and taxes but that may change as well in the future.</p>

    <p>Google websites</p>
    <ol>
      <li>So I've been looking at google website builder and what they have right now is very clumsy. It is clumsy because it forces the user to arrange elements on the screen and choose from a very limited set of items. There is support for google drive components (forms, sheets, docs etc) but simple things like positioning description etc is off. So it gives me a bit of hope for muddha.</li>
      <li>The kind of website builder we're building would be very different from the one that google has. We'll give the user an ability to choose from a set of predefined themes. We'll let the user to add content on that theme (by allowing him to upload products, or writing descriptions) and that's it. There will be no need to fiddle with the header images, or to drag and drop components at the perfect location. Most of it will be automatic with a few customization options. The idea is that the users does not have any time to dally around with the page. He wants something to be up quickly so that he can start working on his main business (i.e selling stuff)  </li>
