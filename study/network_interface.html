      <h1>Network Interfaces in Ubuntu</h1>
      <p>What is the problem we are trying to solve?</p>
      <p>We want multiple copies of an application to bind on same ports.
	For example port 80 may be used by different applications with different IP addresses. Since our machine will only have a single IP address we want to create a virtual network from which the applications can be accessed by the outside world</p>
      <p>We don't want to dockerize/kubernetize the application just yet. Because it has a very steep setup time. We won't be dealing on a scale where kubernetes/docker can do us any good. So we just want to use simple tools that are present on any linux os and run multiple copies of a same applications accessible via different virtual ip addresses. If a time comes when we have to move the application to a different machine we can simply configure port forwarding so that the requests from a virtual host go to the specific IP of the machine. </p>
      
      <p>To create virtual IP address we need to</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Add an IP to the /etc/network/interfaces file</li>
        <li>Create an entry of the virtual ip address in the routing table</li>
      </ol>
      <h1>An easy solution is to maintain a single nginx with multiple server blocks for each of the clients. The problem is that I'll have to map port numbers on my domain name provider. Now this would be all right if the domain name provider was under our control. But if we have to use a third party service provider. </h1>
