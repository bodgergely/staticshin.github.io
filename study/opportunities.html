      <h1>Company Registration</h1>
      <small>
	I might not have to go through the hassle of registering a company from day 1 if paypal <a href="/study/paypal.html#p_c">approves</a> parent child accounts for my business. I can start these processes in the background and let them proceed at their own pace.
      </small>
      <p>On Oct 2 2016 the Ministry of Corporate Affairs launched Simplified Proforma for Incorporating Company Electronically (SPICE), which I should be able to use to register my company.</p>
      <p>The MCA has a scheme for One person companies. It's just like sole proprietorship but it gives the benefit of a limited liability company.</p>
      <p><strong>Notes on one person company</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
	  A person can only be a member of one OPC.
          <small>[Essentially what this means is that if I'll be providing services under the banner of two companies one of them has to be registered as a private or a public company. I already have wrinq registered as a limited company in the UK so this arrangement should work well for the time being. At a later stage I'll migrate wrinq to India as well]</small>

    <h1>Conferences</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I'll be attending the BBC growing mobile audience event at the google tower on 19 Apr 2017.
	If I <a href="/activity-logs/todo.html">do well</a>
	there is a chance that I can win a big client.
	Or who knows maybe some other small ones :) </li>
      <li>On May 12 there is an amazon conference in Delhi at JW Marriott hotel.  I need to make sure that:-
        <ol>
          <li>I get some free aws credit for my startup</li>
          <li>I get the information of a decision maker at Mariott that I can sell my app to</li>
        </ol>
	This would be a great opportunity for me. I need to ensure that I kill multiple birds with a stone.

      <strong>Notes on e-residency</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>To establish a company in estonia you need to have a legal address. If there is no physical presence a virtual office <a href="https://e-residency.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205207022-Getting-an-Estonian-Address">may be purchased</a></li>
        <li>Application fee of &pound;100,damn!(will have to figure something out)</li>

      <p><strong>Why Estonia?</strong> [Application for e-residency program]</p>
      <p> I'm Akshat,I'm an entrepreneur living in India. I'm building a startup that allows independent home owners to promote and manage their rental properties. As an E-resident of Estonia I hope to administrate an international company from anywhere in the world and sell our products not only to tour operators and accommodation providers within Estonia but also expand to other EU countries. With its emphasis on e-governance , its support to international startups , it's vibrant tourism industry that is connected with entire EU region, Estonia makes for an ideal country for us to run our business in. </p>

      <p><strong>Notes on the innovation summit</strong></p>
     
      <p>The summit costs RS 2700 for a non member. It's not a lot of money but attending conferences is mostly a waste of time. The real networking happens after the event is done. During the conference three things are absolute:-</p>
      <ol>
        <li>No one will remember what you say to them, so that when you contact a person again you'll have to introduce yourself once more.</li>
        <li> You'll be spending a lot of time inside closed rooms being bored to death.
	  (It's worse than lectures at college)</li>
        <li>The speakers on the stage act like celebrities, "Oh I forgot to bring my card sorry (XO)","Oh could you drop me a line on my email?","What is your value proposition?"</li>
      </ol>

      <p><em>So what are we going to do?</em></p>
      <p>We're going to play it smart. We could crash but even crashing is <a href="/activity-logs/index.html#decision">not worth</a> it (unless you count the free food), but we can try for the thrills <3. The <a href="http://ficci-thtc.com/speaker/">speaker list</a>,<a href="http://ficci-thtc.com/who-will-attend/">the attendee list</a> and even the <a href="http://ficci-thtc.com/programme/">programme details</a> are public. We can use our imagination cook up a story and get a meeting.</p>
