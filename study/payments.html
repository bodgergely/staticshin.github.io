      <li>I've gotten a new bank account which means that I can use paypal to set up a new business account altogether with a new identity. And moreover having multiple paypal accounts is not <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/Can-I-have-multiple-PayPal-accounts-FAQ762">discouraged</a></li>

	[It seems that parent child accounts are only for people in US. Which means that I need to put in some generic name that I can use as a placeholder for collecting payments in multiple businesses]

      <h1>Notes on collecting payments</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>We don't have to limit ourselves to paypal. The customers will either be local/foreign</li>
        <li>For local customers we'll provide the flexibility of making payments via NEFT bank transfers, UPI, or even cheque. These payments can be made offline.</li>
        <li>For foreign customers the payments must be made online. But we can give them options to make a payment either via paypal or by a wire transfer directly into the bank</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	<small>For manual payments our operational costs increase. If we'll have to talk to the customer to release the payment every time then we'll have to set a hard limit on the number of customers that we can address. That is not a problem because we'll do a research on finding the optimal number of customers anyway. We don't want to take on more than we can chew here. All the operational efforts must be planned in a way that it is possible for a single person to handle everything.
