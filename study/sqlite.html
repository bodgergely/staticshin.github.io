   <small> [One liner for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25675314/how-to-backup-sqlite-database">sql lite backups</a>]</small>

    <ol>
      <li>My experiments with <a href="https://github.com/brickcap/openresty_examples/tree/master/sqlite"></a>sqlite were successful. It can indeed function as a very effective JSON document database. </li>
      <li>
	I discovered <a href="http://ulua.io/luarocks_packages.html">ulua</a>
	that allows me to run an embedded web server on luajit. I can embed the sqlite library in the webserver and access sqlite3 over http. 
      </li>
      <li id="http_rel_json">Combining the sqlite capabilities of storing and querying JSON objects and embedded webserver running on luajit I can get an http, document oriented database that's accessible from any program that has the capability of making http requests. It also allows me to replicate some of the <a href="#e_features">features</a> of other json oriented databases. </li>
      <li id="in_memory">From what I understand the JSON extension parses the stored json in realtime (at a rate of 250 mb/sec) and then stores it in a vritual table. I'm not sure if that virtual table is kept in memory or on disk. If the virtual table is stored in memory then it might be trouble because I don't want to deal with big in memory databases. </li>
      <li>To avoid the limitations of in memory storage I can design my keys more efficiently and store the data I want to query on a different column as well. Yes it will duplicate the data on disk,but disk is cheap. Furthermore since sqlite is embedded I can create a separate file for each database. So that in future if any one database becomes a bottleneck I can simply put it on a different machine.</li>
      <li>On the other hand the in memory database could be useful for certain operations like storing cookies. So understanding them will help me get more out of sqlite.</li>
