        <ol>
          <li>
	    <p><strong>It's nginx we know and love</strong></p>
	    <p>
	      Say you are the developer of one of those 23 millions websites [1] that
	      use nginx as their webserver and you see this shiny new thing called
	      <a href="http://openresty.org/">openresty</a> and you say to yourself 
	    </p>
            <p>"Bah! HUMBUG! I can't afford to break my pretty nginx configruations!! Humbug! Bah!" </p> 
            <p>
	      Ah yes. I understand the feeling pretty well.
	      It's a dilemma faced by many programmers who hear about operesty for the first time.
	      "Should we migrate or should we stay with nginx?" But they miss the point. Openresty is not a
	      fork of nginx. It is nginx. Or maybe I should say it is nginx +</p>
	    
	    <p>
	      Bundled together with some well tested third party modules and integrated
	      with luajit it gives the developers the ability to <em>program</em> nginx. Yes
	      I said program. You are not just limited to configuring the webserver (although you can still use
	      it that way) but you can actually write code. And we are not talking about some wierd pseudo
	      language that nginx gave you by default. We are talking about a real programming language -- lua.
	      And that's about it. Nothing else changes.
	    </p>
            <p>So let me type this in strong --
              <strong>openresty is nginx</strong>-- and this in small --
	      <small>with extra goodies packaged together in a nice little bundle</small>.
	      Your existing configuration
	      will continue to work with openresty.
	      You might need to do some additional
	      work if you've installed third party modules.
	      Even then there is a pretty good possibility that
	      your favorite third party nginx module comes budled with openresty.
	      In the worst case scenario
	      you might need to install those bundles again
	      but the default stuff works out of the box.
	      And that makes for a damn smooth migration.

	  </li>
          <li><p><strong>Fast</strong></p></li>
          <p>I know nginx is fast.
	    You know nginx is fast.
	    Everybody knows nginx is fast. The question is
	    <em>"Is it still fast with lua?"</em>
	  </p>
          <p>
	    Yes it is,
	    it
	    <a href="http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r11&hw=peak&test=json">
	      seems
	    </a>.
	    openresty uses luajit to compile lua code. The code compiled with lua jit is
	    damn <a href="http://luajit.org/performance.html">fast</a>.
	    And you've got one lua jit vm per nginx worker process.  
	  </p>
          <li><p><strong>Low memory footprint</strong></p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Lua</strong></p></li>
	  
          <li><p><strong>*by_lua directives</strong></p></li>

          <p>"Lua code inside strings is ugly yuck! yuck! yuck!"</p>
          <p>Calm down old fellow. I belive that saying yuck! one time is quite
	    enough to convey the feeling of repugnance that a programmer feels when he has to
	    write code embbded in strings.</p>

	  <p>I will concede that emotions run high when the debugger fails to tell at exactly
	    what line the error has occured. And in this situation it is
	    quite okay to say yuck! yuck! to emphasize that the disgust is quite strong. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    But in my opnion saying yuck! yuck! yuck! three times in quick succession helps no one.
	    I mean to say that the feeling of strong disgust has already been conveyed by saying "yuck!"
	    two times and a third utterance of yuck! only weakens the effect. Infact I believe that
	    it would be far more powerful to say "yuck" and just leave it hanging there.
	    Don't even use an exclamation mark to close it off. Imagine <a href="">Alan Rickman</a> saying Yuck
	    and try to capture that effect when you speak. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    With that out of the way... you don't need to use strings to write lua code. You can
	    have your all your lua in a file and refrence to that file using the *by_lua_file.
	    All *by_lua directives have an equivalent *by_lua_file directive as well so you are not
	    really bound to single choice. That clears up the clouds I hope :)

	<p>[1] "You pulled that number out of your ass?" </p>
        <p>I certainly did not! I feel offended that the idea even crossed your mind.
	  Like any responsible writer when I put a number like this on an article
	  you can be certain of the fact that I did a google search and accepted the figure that came out of the
	  <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/Web-Server/nginx">first result</a>
	  without doing any kind of cross checking or verifying the validity of the statistics. You may
          accuse me of laziness but I'm certainly not "pulling numbers out of ass" type.
