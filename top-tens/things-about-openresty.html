        <ol>
          <li>
	    <p><strong>It's nginx we know and love</strong></p>
	    <p>
	      Say you are the developer of one of those 23 millions websites [1] that
	      use nginx as their webserver and you see this shiny new thing called
	      <a href="http://openresty.org/">openresty</a> and you say to yourself 
	    </p>
            <p>"Bah! HUMBUG! I can't afford to break my pretty nginx configruations!! Humbug! Bah!" </p> 
            <p>
	      Ah yes. I understand the feeling pretty well.
	      It's a dilemma faced by many programmers who hear about openresty for the first time.
	      "Should we migrate or should we stay with nginx?" But they miss the point. Openresty is not a
	      fork of nginx. It is nginx. Or maybe I should say it is nginx +</p>
	    
	    <p>
	      Bundled together with some well tested third party modules and integrated
	      with luajit it gives the developers the ability to <em>program</em> nginx. Yes
	      I said program. You are not just limited to configuring the webserver (although you can still use
	      it that way) but you can actually write code. And we are not talking about some wierd pseudo
	      language that nginx gave you by default. We are talking about a real programming language -- lua.
	      And that's about it. Nothing else changes.
	    </p>
            <p>So let me type this in bold --
              <strong>openresty is nginx</strong>-- and this in small --
	      <small>with extra goodies packaged together in a nice little bundle</small>.
	      Your existing configuration
	      will continue to work with openresty.
	      You might need to do some additional
	      work if you've installed third party modules.
	      Even then there is a pretty good possibility that
	      your favorite nginx module comes budled with openresty.
	      In the worst case scenario
	      you might need to install those bundles again
	      but the default stuff works out of the box.
	      And that makes for a damn smooth migration.
	      
	    </p>
            
	  </li>
          <li><p><strong>Fast</strong></p></li>
          <p>I know nginx is fast.
	    You know nginx is fast.
	    Everybody knows nginx is fast. The question is
	    <em>"Is it still fast with lua?"</em>
	  </p>
          <p>
	    Yes it is,
	    it
	    <a href="http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r11&hw=peak&test=json">
	      seems
	    </a>.
	    openresty uses luajit to compile lua code. The code compiled with lua jit is
	    damn <a href="http://luajit.org/performance.html">fast</a> reaching alomst c levels of
	    performance.
	  </p>
          <li><p><strong>Low memory footprint</strong></p></li>
          <p>I know nginx's memory footprint is small. You know that
	    nginx's memory footprint is small. Everybody knows that nginx's memory
	    footprint is small. The question is <em> Is it still small with lua?</em> </p>
          <p>
	    Yes it is. It seems. Here's an old benchmark done by the author of openresty.

            <blockquote>
	      <p> Below is the result using the command http_load -p 10 -s 5 http://localhost:8080/ on my ThinkPad T400 laptop with ngx_openresty 1.0.10.1:</p>

	      <p>139620 fetches, 10 max parallel, 1.67544e+06 bytes, in 5.00001 seconds
		12 mean bytes/connection
		27923.9 fetches/sec, 335087 bytes/sec
		msecs/connect: 0.0531258 mean, 4.076 max, 0.014 min
		msecs/first-response: 0.258796 mean, 5.353 max, 0.067 min
		HTTP response codes:
		code 200 -- 139620
	      </p>
	      <p>So on my laptop, for only a single worker nginx server, we've got ~28k r/s. The memory footprint of the node process under load is 38.0m VIRT, 2.5m RES.</p>

            </blockquote>
	  <p>The same test when repeated for node js gives the following result</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>And node.js v0.6.1 yields 10k r/s:</p>
            <p>51206 fetches, 10 max parallel, 614472 bytes, in 5 seconds
	      12 mean bytes/connection
	      10241.2 fetches/sec, 122894 bytes/sec
	      msecs/connect: 0.0356567 mean, 1.316 max, 0.019 min
	      msecs/first-response: 0.916395 mean, 14.236 max, 0.077 min
	      HTTP response codes:
	      code 200 -- 51206</p>
            <p>The memory footprint of the node process under load is 629m VIRT, 50m RES.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
	    The low memory footprint of openresty is not surprising when you consider that the other thing that
	    lua jit is famous for,besides it's speed,
	    is it's ability to run in an embedded mode. It seems that the VM is just
	    115 KB in size.  Compared to that when all is said and done this page is about 500 Kb in size.
	    Which makes this simple html page heavier than the lua jit vm.   
	  </p>
          <li><p><strong>Lua</strong></p></li>
          <p>I know that nignx... you know that nginx... everybody knows that nginx...
	    wait this won't work here. Let's try something else.</p>
          <p>
	    Openresty uses lua as the programming language. Now lua has some pretty
	    cool things like the ability to return multiple values from a function
	    (which is used brilliantly by the way in the ngx.location.capture api),
	    declaring multiple variables on a single line, co routines to pause and
	    start the execution of functions etc. It has a very familliar syntax and
	    decent amount of third party modules. 
	  </p>
          <p>But there are a couple of things that can be off putting to a person just starting
	    out. Like for example arrays that start with 1. No ternanry operators.
	    For some people it can be a bit too verbose with all those end statements.
	    But these "problems", if you want to call it that, is just a matter of getting used
	    to the language. The only serious difficulty that I had while I was learning lua was
	    getting my head around 1 based array indices.
	    Once you get used to lua,which should be pretty quick anyways,
	    you wouldn't mind these petty things. 	    
	  </p>
          <p>Lua makes sense as a language of choice for openresty because it's highly embeddable and it has
	    luajit. Which as we all know is damn fast and damn conversvative when it comes to
	    resrouce usage. Hot Damn!</p>
          <li><p><strong>*by_lua directives</strong></p></li>
          <p>
	    You get to use all the sweet goodness of lua using the *by_lua directives of openresty.
	    These directives do diffrent things depending upon the context they are run in. The
	    <code>lua_code_cache</code> directive for instance turns the caching of lua code
	    on/off. That might increase the perfomace of our program but it does not let us sample
	    the sweet goodness of lua in nginx. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    For that consider <code>access_by_lua</code> directive which allows you to do
	    some lua processing during the access phase of an nginx request. Or
            <code>rewrite_by_lua</code> directive that allows you to inject lua into the
	    nginx rewrite rquest phase. 
	  </p>
          <p>Cool right? At the very least these directives should give you a good excuse to learn more about the
            <a href="http://www.nginxguts.com/2011/01/phases/"> http request processing phases</a>
	    of nginx so  you can inject lua code and hack it.
	  </p>
          <p>"Lua code inside strings is ugly yuck! yuck! yuck!"</p>
          <p>Calm down old fellow. I belive that saying yuck! one time is quite
	    enough to convey the feeling of repugnance that a programmer feels when he has to
	    write code embbded in strings.</p>

	  <p>I will concede that emotions run high when the debugger fails to tell at exactly
	    what line the error has occured. And in this situation it is
	    quite okay to say yuck! yuck! to emphasize that the disgust is quite strong. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    But in my opnion saying yuck! yuck! yuck! three times in quick succession helps no one.
	    I mean to say that the feeling of strong disgust has already been conveyed by saying "yuck!"
	    two times and a third utterance of the word yuck! only weakens the effect. Infact I believe that
	    it would be far more powerful to say "yuck" and just leave it hanging there.
	    Don't even use an exclamation mark to close it off. Imagine
	    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rickman">Alan Rickman</a> saying Yuck
	    and try to capture that effect when you speak. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    With that out of the way... you don't need to use strings to write lua code. You can
	    have your all your lua in a file and refrence to that file using the *by_lua_file.
	    All *by_lua directives have an equivalent *by_lua_file directive as well so you are not
	    really bound to single choice. Or if you insist upon inlining your lua code  you'd find 
	    the *by_lua_block directives ,that allow you to write lua code inside "{}", quite useful.
	    That clears up the clouds I hope :) 
	  </p>
	  <li><p><strong>ngx.location.capture.multi --the ultimate api mashup tool</strong></p></li>
          <p>
	    ngx.location.capture is easily my favorite thing about openresty. In simple
	    terms it allows you to make
	    <a href="/programming/definitely-an-open-resty-guide/#loc_cap_faq">synchronous yet non blocking</a>
	    subrequests to nginx's location blocks. 
	  </p>
          <p><em>"Okay so what's so cool about it?"</em></p>
          <p>Well here's what's cool.
	    You know how location blocks can use
	    <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass">proxy_pass</a>
	    directives to pass requests to different servers right? With location capture api you can
	    get a response from the proxied server in your code. The implication of this is that
	    you can have multiple services deployed in different locations and make requests from them
	  </p>
          
          <p>
	    Think microservices.
	    Let's say your application has different services for authentication,
	    billing and notification operations.You can have these services proxied
	    with nginx locations and access them cleanly in lua with location.capture.	    
	  </p>
          <p>
	    The good thing about proxying through locations is that you can use the
	    same method to proxy both external and internal systems. For example say
	    you are bulding a system that requires calling external apis of mailchimp,
	    paypal and amazon. To make these api's available all you need to do is
	    configure thier respective location blocks. And that's it. You can now start
	    making requests to them from your lua code. 
	  </p>
          <li><p><strong>Simplified application architechture</strong></p></li>
          <p>
	    The lua directives offer a clean speration of the request coming in to nginx.
	    Well to be precise nginx has a well defined cycle which a request must go through
	    before a final response is sent. What openresty offers is the ability to inject lua
	    code into into these request phases. 
	  </p>
          <p>So for example an access_by_lua handler can allow you to inject lua while nginx process
	    a request in an access phase. Effectively what this does is it allows you to write aribitray code
	    that can reject a request then and there before it moves on to other handlers. This is very useful
	    if you want to reject unauthorized access to a location block or configure a blacklist of ip
	    addresses or impose other restrictions on the service of a request. 
	  </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
location / {
access_by_lua_block {	      
local headers = ngx.req.get_headers()
local uname_pass = 'abc:def'
if  headers["Authorization"] ~= "Basic "..ngx.encode_base64(uname_pass) then
   ngx.header["WWW-Authenticate"]="Basic"
   ngx.req.clear_header("Authorization")
   return  ngx.exit(ngx.HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED)
end
ngx.exit(ngx.OK)
 }
}
	    </code>
          </pre>
          <p><em>"But exactly how does it simplify the architechture"</em></p>
          <p>First the practice of code reusablity is highly encouraged.
	    Once you have written an access rule you can reuse the same code by refrencing it
	    from different access_by_lua file. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    Second it allows you to think of your code in terms of request processing phase handlers
	    cleanly breaking down each action and tying it down to a particular handler. So your
	    authorization/authentication code will be handled by the access_directive.  
	  </p>
	  
	  <li><p><strong>A good mix of configurability and programability</strong></p></li>
          <p>
	    A definitive advantage that you get with nginx is the number things
	    that you can do with the modules that are already available. Being a proxy
	    server with one or two lines of configuration you can set block lists for ip
	    addresses,route requests to different handlers. Configure the security headers
	    for your applicaiton. Openresty allows you to do more or perform things that
	    were not possible or difficult to do with just configuration directives. 
	  </p>
	  
          <li><p><strong>Unified proxy and Application servers</strong></p></li>
          <p>
	    Where as before you had to maintain different proxy and applicaton servers
	    openresty gives you an opportunity to combine your application and proxy
	    requirements into a single server. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    On the other hand if you already have an existing application server openresty still
	    gives you the benifit of offloading some of the minor but resource consuming tasks
	    to it and take some pressure off of your main servers.
	    So by using openresty instead of nginx you get to have more options.
	  </p>
          <li><p><strong>Concurrency</strong></p></li>
          <p>Saved the best for the last. Openresty is higly concurrent. Each nginx worker
	    process has comes with an instance of lua jit to compile the lua code. The content handlers
	    themselves are run in light threads. So there can be multiple execution points per lua jit instance
	    making it very
	    <a href="programming/definitely-an-open-resty-guide/#concurrency_in_openresty">
	      difficult to write blocking code</a> in openresty.
	  </p>
        </ol>
	<p>[1] "You pulled that number out of your ass?" </p>
        <p>I certainly did not! I feel offended that the idea even crossed your mind.
	  Like any responsible writer when I put a number like this on an article
	  you can be certain of the fact that I did a google search and accepted the figure that came out of the
	  <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/Web-Server/nginx">first result</a>
	  without doing any kind of cross checking or verifying the validity of the statistic. You may
          accuse me of laziness but I'm certainly not "pulling numbers out of ass" type.
