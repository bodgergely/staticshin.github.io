        <ol>
          <li>
	    <p><strong>It's nginx we know and love</strong></p>
	    <p>
	      Say you are the developer of one of those 23 millions websites [1] that
	      use nginx and you see this shiny new thing called openresty and you say to yourself 
	    </p>
            <p>"Bah! HUMBUG! I can't afford to break my pretty ngxinx configruations!! Humbug! bah!" </p>
            <p></p>
            
	  </li>
            <li><p><strong>ngx.location.capture--the ultimate api mashup tool</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Fast</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Low memory footprint</strong></p></li>
          <li><p><strong>*by_lua directives</strong></p></li>
          <p>"Lua code inside strings is ugly yuck! yuck! yuck!"</p>
          <p>Calm down old fellow. I belive that saying yuck! one time is quite
	    enough to convey the feeling of repugnance that a programmer feels when he has to
	    write code embbded in strings.</p>

	  <p>I will concede that emotions run high when the debugger fails to tell at exactly
	    what line the error has occured. And in this situation it is
	    quite okay to say yuck! yuck! to emphasize that the disgust is quite strong. 
	  </p>
          <p>
	    But in my opnion saying yuck! yuck! yuck! three times in quick succession helps no one.
	    I mean to say that the feeling of strong disgust has already been conveyed by saying "yuck!"
	    two times and a third utterance of yuck! only weakens the effect. Infact I believe that
	    it would be far more powerful to say "yuck" and just leave it hanging there.
	    Don't even use an exclamation mark to close it off.  
	  </p>
          <p>
	    With that out of the way... you don't need to use strings to write lua code. You can
	    have your all your lua in a file and refrence to that file using the *by_lua_file.
	    All *by_lua directives have an equivalent *by_lua_file directive as well so you are not
	    really bound to single choice. That clears up the clouds I hope :)

            <li><p><strong>lua</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Concurrent</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>A good mix of configurability and programability</strong></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>unified proxy and application servers</strong></p></li>
        </ol>
	<p>[1] "You pulled that number out of your ass?" </p>
        <p>I certainly did not! I feel offended that the idea even crossed your mind.
	  Like any responsible writer when I put a number like this on an article
	  you can be certain of the fact that I did a google search and accepted the figure that came out of the
	  <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/Web-Server/nginx">first result</a>
	  without doing any kind of cross checking or verifying the validity of the statistics. You may
          accuse me of laziness but I'm certainly not "pulling numbers out of ass" type.
