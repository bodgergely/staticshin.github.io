      <h1>With or without you</h1>

      <div class="postBody"><p>When Capcom showed the stage demo for Monster Hunter Portable Third many of us assumed that it won’t be long before they announce a brand new Monster Hunter game for the vita.A year has passed since and though Capcom has shown a lot of love for the vita,it seems they are still reluctant to bring one of their most popular franchises to sony’s new handheld.Now the vita is not doing too well in japan and while a new Monster Hunter title can certainly improve it’s prospects,things are not as bad as they seem.Slowly but surely there are a new breed of hunting games that are coming up which can potentially fill the Monster Hunter void for the vita owners :</p>

<h3 id="phantasy-star-online-2">Phantasy Star Online 2</h3>
<p>Phantasy Star Portable was probably the biggest multiplayer game on the psp besides Monster Hunter.The two titles on the psp were a continuation of the Phantasy Star Universe which debuted on Xbox.Early in 2012 Sega announced that PSO 2 ,sequel to one of the most popular dreamcast games, will be coming to the Vita.Needless to say that the news was pleasantly shocking.PSO2 is a big game,it will probably the biggest game on the vita once its released, and the fact that the devs will be able to pull it off on the vita would would do it’s reputation a lot of good.What is even more amazing is that this game is absolutely <strong>FREE!</strong> to play.At the moment the game is is open beta stage and Sega says that it is on track for an early 2013 release.</p>

<h3 id="god-eater-2">God Eater 2</h3>

<p>God eater followed the formula of monster hunter very closely.However it also brought in some new gameplay additions to the table.The weapon mechanics in the game were complex since they had the ability to change types.The focus was not on crafting new armour but on creating new bullet types.The bullet customization was very deep while the game itself was a lot more action oriented.It was set in a post apocalyptic town which was very different from the lush environments of monster hunter.God Eater 2 adds new weapons and even more Aragami to fight.Although at this time it is not clear whether the game will be ad Hoc only or support online multiplayer as well.</p>

<h3 id="ragnarok-odyssey">Ragnarok Odyssey</h3>
<p>Game arts have been one of the biggest supporters of the Vita.Within a year they have already released Dokuro,Picotto Knights and Ragnarok Odyssey. Ragnarok odyssey is a loot based online multiplayer game which features heavy action and huge bosses.The main gameplay revolves around defeating monsters collecting cards for abilities and forging new weapons to get stronger and fight even stronger foes!.It has managed to do well on japanese charts though numbers are not anywhere near the Monster Hunter range.But still quite good for a new game on the Vita.Game Arts has expressed plans for making a sequel which is very encouraging.           </p>
